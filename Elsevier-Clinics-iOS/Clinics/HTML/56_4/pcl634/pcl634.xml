P4P has been implemented in other countries besides the United States and is perhaps most advanced in the United Kingdom. Measurement for P4P is evolving, as are the types of incentives; neither is perfect at this time.

This model best addresses both efficiency and quality. Measurement areas include clinical performance, patient satisfaction, and investment in information technology. The clinical measures are similar to HEDIS criteria. Patient satisfaction measures include communication with the physician, timely access to care, specialty care, and overall rating. Measures of technology investment include population management as well as clinical decision support via electronic connection with the pharmacy.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib37"><ce:sup>37</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref></ce:para><ce:para>These prototypical examples of P4P provide a context for future projections of health care delivery models where quality and efficiency peacefully coexist.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="sec9"><ce:section-title>Approach to future pay for performance models</ce:section-title><ce:para>The effectiveness of existing P4P programs has been evaluated in several studies, and the conclusions regarding its impact have been mixed. The need for payment reform is so great that the medical community continues to seek better answers.</ce:para><ce:para>An ideal P4P program of the future would include features of the various models described previously. Community-wide participation has the best potential to transform health care within a geographic region. A consortium of plans associated with physician organizations that have an ongoing open dialogue with purchasers and patient groups might create the right mix to catalyze this process. The emergence of regional physician organizations to manage health information exchange holds the promise of automating clinical data collection and aggregation.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib38"><ce:sup>38</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> Communities of medical specialties such as pediatrics should consider developing common data pools that aggregate information across payers, purchasers, and physicians to have a uniform method for assessing and reporting performance. A common set of national pediatric metrics and their implementation would enable communities to coordinate their efforts across organizations. Without community- or specialty-wide participation, P4P faces a higher risk of failure due to the large burden placed on physicians and their practices.</ce:para><ce:para>Physician organizations are more likely than individual practices to alter the infrastructure of the practice milieu in ways that promote better care delivery. Improved information technology that enables organizations to sample patients crossing many practices will increase statistical and clinical significance of performance data. Another benefit of community-wide or regional organizations as the accountable entity would be that physicians tend to respond better to peer-to-peer reputation incentives rather than external payer pressure. Physician organizations will be more likely to take community-based measures and develop internal implementation guidelines that are ideally suited to the local market. Because enforcement is delegated to the physician organization, it is physician to physician. This approach is more likely to promote a shared sense of accountability for a given patient population. It also allows for a closer alignment between local physician preferences and program design. In such a program, it would be more logical to disburse P4P payments to physician organizations rather than individual physicians.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec10"><ce:section-title>International pay for performance efforts</ce:section-title><ce:para>Other societies are experiencing health care quality issues similar to the United States and have P4P models comparable to the US health care system. For example, the UK&apos;s Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) is one of the world&apos;s most ambitious P4P programs to date.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib39"><ce:sup>39</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> The UK&apos;s National Health Service (NHS) began in 1948. Its problems included long waiting times as well as gaps in performance between the best and worst physicians. Political pressure led to the new &ldquo;patient led NHS&rdquo; resulting in the formation of the QOF in 2004. This change was to be &ldquo;self improving, in which performance was driven by patients&apos; choice, money following the patient, and competition among physicians.&rdquo;<ce:cross-ref refid="bib40"><ce:sup>40</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> The UK P4P trends toward more active monitoring of physician performance rather than placing implicit trust in health care professionals.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib41"><ce:sup>41</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> Primary Care Trusts, statutory bodies responsible for local health care delivery, were later added to provide financial incentives to motivate behavior change. These Primary Care Trusts organized physician practices to help design quality measures, collect data, and implement procedures and guidelines to ensure better outcomes. In the United States, providers (both hospitals and physicians) can organize themselves in a similar way to achieve these goals in a proactive manner.</ce:para><ce:para>Studies from the United Kingdom, consistent with previous work, show that financial incentives can change physician behavior,<ce:cross-ref refid="bib42"><ce:sup>42</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> and that patients receive higher quality care in geographic areas where performance measures and monitoring have been established.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib43"><ce:sup>43</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> The UK&apos;s QOF models competition, patient choice, and payment for results. Its basic premise is that interaction between these three elements will produce the dynamics required for greater efficiency and quality. Shifting of care into the community via PCTs substantiates the principles of consortium and community-wide participation. The United Kingdom seems to be ahead of the United States in the adoption of financial incentives to improve the quality of health care.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec11"><ce:section-title>Summary</ce:section-title><ce:para>There is urgent need for change in the US health care delivery and payment system. P4P is still in its infancy; it will follow its natural progression into some future delivery model. Collaboration among all stakeholders as well as investment of capital, both financial and intellectual, can significantly increase the odds of success of P4P programs. Promoting the emergence of regional physician organizations or trusts to help develop measures, aggregate data, implement quality improvement initiatives, and police their enforcement will allow us to better achieve quality improvement and efficiency. The final solution should be physician driven, patient centered, employer sponsored, and payer administered, with the primary goal of improving the quality of care.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:sections></body><tail><ce:bibliography><ce:section-title>References</ce:section-title><ce:bibliography-sec><ce:bib-reference
