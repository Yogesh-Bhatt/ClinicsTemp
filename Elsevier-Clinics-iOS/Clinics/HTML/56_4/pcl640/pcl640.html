<p class="normal">Data and well-constructed measures quantify suboptimal quality in health care and play a crucial role in improving quality. Measures are useful for three major purposes: (1) driving improvements in outcomes of care by prioritizing and selecting appropriate interventions, (2) developing comparative quality reports for consumer and payer decision making and health system accountability, and (3) creating incentives that pay for performance. This article describes the current landscape for measurement in pediatrics compared to adult care, provides a case study of the development and application of a publicly available and federally funded pediatric indicator set using routinely collected hospital discharge data, and addresses challenges and opportunities in selecting and using measures as a function of intended purpose.</p>

<p class="indent1">A 1-year-old undergoes abdominal surgery, and her parents are relieved it is over, start to relax, and make plans for returning home. Three days later, their baby returns to the operating room for reclosure of postoperative disruption of the abdominal wall. A 7-year-old complains loudly to his mother about sharp belly pains in his lower right side; she calls the pediatrician's office and is told to come right in. Lacking transportation, she does not make it in with the boy, and no one calls to see why. That night, he is writhing and they take a cab to the emergency room from where he is rushed to the operating room to remove his rupturing appendix.</p>
<p class="indent">These two stories hit us in the gut, quite literally. Anecdotes of suboptimal care make us ask what could have been done to avoid the bad outcome for that child. But how do we know how well the health care system is doing on a larger scale? Data and well-constructed measures can quantify the scale of the problem and thereby direct efforts to make improvements. From 2000 to 2003, the rate of wound dehiscence requiring a return to the operating room during the same hospitalization remained steady at 0.76 cases per 1000 abdominopelvic surgeries, and the rate of perforated appendix was also unchanged, but much higher, at 31% of appendectomies.<a title="" href="#bib1" name="back-bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">A clarion call has sounded for children's health care<a title="" href="#bib2" name="back-bib2"><sup>2</sup></a> to develop interventions to improve outcomes of care, develop comparative quality reports for decision making and accountability, and create incentives that pay for performance. Each of these three goals requires data and measures. This article describes the context for measurement in pediatrics, provides a case study of the development of an indicator set using routinely collected hospital discharge data, and addresses considerations for selecting and using measures in various circumstances.</p>
<div id="sec2" />
<p id="lv_0004" class="level2">The current measurement landscape and pediatrics</p>
<p class="indent">Many researchers, governmental agencies at the federal and state levels, provider organizations, and health care payers have instituted quality measurement aimed at performance improvement. In 2006, the Institute of Medicine published “Performance Measurement: Accelerating Improvement,” a report from their Committee on Redesigning Health Insurance Performance Measures, Payment, and Performance Improvement Programs.<a title="" href="#bib3" name="back-bib3"><sup>3</sup></a> This report highlighted the incredible proliferation of measures and consequent need for standardization to mitigate the potential burdens of excessive measurement and reporting requirements. Because the report resulted from a congressional mandate oriented toward the Medicare program, there was scant coverage of children's health, but there was a clear message that measurement is important to quality improvement.</p>
<p class="indent">Measure development in children's health is at an earlier stage compared with adult medicine, with a need for more measures across all settings of care.<a name="back-bib4" href="#bib4"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib5" href="#bib5"><sup>5</sup></a> At some stage in the future, though, the same problem of a plethora of measures and insufficient standardization could emerge for children's health. An obstacle to rational measurement in pediatrics—development of the right number of measures, covering the right areas, available at the right moment—may be the fragmented payment terrain and, thus, a lack of a single entity or program (eg, Medicare) that can provide the necessary incentives to make health care quality measurement and underlying information infrastructures as crucial as they are becoming for adult care.<a name="back-bib6" href="#bib6"><sup>6</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib7" href="#bib7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, motivation for quality measurement in pediatrics is increasing because reports show that quality gaps exist in pediatric ambulatory, emergency room, and hospital care that are similar to those demonstrated in adult settings.<a name="back-bib8" href="#bib8"><sup>8–11</sup></a> Simply applying adult indicators to younger age ranges is insufficient in many situations. Specific challenges arise from the “four Ds” that distinguish children from “little adults:” differential epidemiology, dependency, demographics, and development.<a name="back-bib4" href="#bib4"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib12" href="#bib12"><sup>12</sup></a> Whether developing child health indicators from scratch or based on adult analogs, measure developers must consider the implications of each of these factors to produce robust indicators and comprehensive measure sets (<a title="" href="#tbl1" name="back-tbl1" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Table 1</a>). Although there are special challenges in pediatrics, many of the approaches to indicator development, assessment, and application are similar regardless of age of the patient population of interest.</p>

<p class="indent">Numerous frameworks exist for assessing indicators and measure sets, and vary somewhat with regard to the purpose of measurement (eg, comparative reporting among countries,<a title="" href="#bib13" name="back-bib13"><sup>13</sup></a> national consensus measures for use in public reporting and quality improvement,<a title="" href="#bib14" name="back-bib14"><sup>14</sup></a> and inclusion in a clearinghouse of measures<a title="" href="#bib15" name="back-bib15"><sup>15</sup></a>). In addition, composite measures that combine similar measures are becoming more prevalent in health care. Through their consensus process, the National Quality Forum (NQF) is currently reviewing a composite pediatric patient safety measure<a title="" href="#bib16" name="back-bib16"><sup>16</sup></a> and developing criteria to assess such composites.<a title="" href="#bib17" name="back-bib17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The American Academy of Pediatrics' Steering Committee on Quality Improvement and Management and Committee on Practice and Ambulatory Medicine published a policy statement in early 2008 on “Principles for the Development and Use of Quality Measures.” They noted, “measures are an important component of improving quality,” believing that “the primary purpose of quality measurement should be to identify opportunities to improve patient care and outcomes, including health status and satisfaction.”<a title="" href="#bib18" name="back-bib18"><sup>18</sup></a>Box 1 summarizes their recommendations for measure development and compares these to the NQF framework.<a title="" href="#bib19" name="back-bib19"><sup>19</sup></a> The NQF currently leads a national effort aimed at improving American health care through the endorsement of consensus-based standards. In pediatrics, diverse stakeholders have centralized around these efforts, including national, state, and regional groups representing clinicians and health care professionals, consumers, private and public employers, hospitals, and research organizations and institutions (eg, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions [NACHRI], Child Health Corporation of America, the Alliance for Pediatric Quality, and the Hospital Quality Alliance).</p>

<p class="indent">Despite increasing measurement-related activities, there remain a limited number of indicators available in pediatrics, particularly for care that crosses settings and for ambulatory care. Additional indicator development is needed to feed into endorsement and reporting processes aimed at catalyzing performance improvement. Development efforts geared to specific areas provide the greatest opportunity to provide meaningful measures. For example, in 2003, the Joint Commission spurred activity on inpatient asthma measures for inclusion in their ORYX performance measurement initiative. As a result, the Pediatric Data Quality Systems Collaborative Measures Workgroup formed and focused first on asthma care and more recently on the pediatric ICU environment, vetting numerous potential indicators and ultimately seeking and receiving endorsement for several measures for each clinical situation.<a title="" href="#bib20" name="back-bib20"><sup>20</sup></a> Two of the asthma measures are already available in “Hospital Compare”<a title="" href="#bib21" name="back-bib21"><sup>21</sup></a> for consumer decision making in hospital selection.</p>
<div id="sec3" />
<p id="lv_0006" class="level2">Case study: development of the agency for healthcare research and quality pediatric quality indicators</p>
<p class="indent">Another major recent effort, the AHRQ Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDIs), offers an example of measure development that builds on previous efforts and uses a standardized methodology to develop a full set of indicators.<a name="back-bib1" href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib22" href="#bib22"><sup>22</sup></a> The approach to the development of the AHRQ PDIs mirrored that used for earlier AHRQ indicator modules, originally developed by the University of California San Francisco–Stanford Evidence-Based Practice Center, with collaborators from other institutions including the University of California Davis and Battelle Memorial Institute.<a title="" href="#bib23" name="back-bib23"><sup>23</sup></a> Indicators from previous AHRQ sets provided the candidate list for the initial pediatric module to keep the task manageable within the resources available and to limit the sets to those that could be implemented with routinely collected hospital discharge data. This data source is ubiquitous, providing the ability to make comparisons between individual hospitals or among similar types of hospitals (eg, nonspecialized community hospitals, children's specialty hospitals). On the other hand, administrative discharge data lack important clinical details, making risk adjustment for accurate quality assessment and fair comparisons more challenging.</p>
<p class="indent">The team's indicator set development process for the PDIs and other AHRQ indicator modules is serial and iterative, as shown in <a title="" href="#fig1" name="back-fig1" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 1</a>. The first task is to identify all of the possible indicators from multiple sources. Consulting the research literature and seeking ideas from key informants about indicators in use but not reported in the literature result in a candidate list of indicators for a given purpose. The goal for the candidate list is to identify as many potential indicators as possible for the anticipated use. Sometimes there will be areas of clinical significance for which no indicators exist. In these cases, new indicators could be developed by using quality concepts from Donabedian's classic framework of structure, process, and outcome of care.<a title="" href="#bib24" name="back-bib24"><sup>24</sup></a> Is there a structural element of care, such as neonatal ICU level, that has been shown to correspond to quality? Is there a process of care, such as weight checks every 2 weeks on patients who have eating disorders, that has not been adopted in a measure but emanates from a clinical guideline or standard of care? Is there an outcome, such as disease-free survival in patients who have acute lymphocytic leukemia, that might vary from one setting to another on the basis of quality of care? Looking at clinical guidelines, practice standards, trigger tools from the patient safety literature, and other evaluations showing a connection between something that might be measured and high-quality care is a more time-intensive approach to identifying potential indicators.</p>

<p class="indent">After a candidate list of indicators is assembled, the team's process requires a thorough review of each indicator drawing from published literature, external input, and further research (<a title="" href="#fig2" name="back-fig2" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 2</a>). The overall review is guided by a series of questions relating to the scientific soundness and usability of the indicator (<a title="" href="#fig3" name="back-fig3" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 3</a>). When evidence from the readily available sources is inconclusive, the evaluation process requires a clinical panel review.</p>

<p class="indent">This structured review by a multidisciplinary group of clinicians establishes consensual validity, which “extends face validity from one expert to a panel of experts who examine and rate the appropriateness of each item.”<a title="" href="#bib25" name="back-bib25"><sup>25</sup></a> For the PDIs review, 19 national organizations nominated 125 individuals, from which 45 panelists were selected to create four panels with applicable and diverse membership in terms of setting (eg geographic region, community hospital, children's hospital, and ambulatory care) and field of practice (eg, adolescent medicine, allergy/immunology, cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, endocrinology, family medicine, general pediatrics, general surgery, hematology/oncology, hospital medicine, infectious diseases, pulmonology, neonatology, neurosurgery, nursing, radiology, and urology).</p>
<p class="indent">Adapting the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method,<a title="" href="#bib26" name="back-bib26"><sup>26</sup></a> the process for clinical panel assessment consists of sending each panelist a packet of background information and a questionnaire for each indicator, reviewing each panelist's ratings and comments, and using areas of disagreement to develop an agenda for moderated discussion by way of telephone with all panel members, followed by final independent assessment by clinician panelists using the same questionnaire. For the PDIs, a previous clinical panel review questionnaire was modified to seek input on different indicator applications, specifically comparative reporting among hospitals and quality improvement within a hospital. In earlier work on the AHRQ Patient Safety Indicators, quality indicators were mostly used for quality improvement, and comparative reporting applications were rare. Additional indicators for the PDIs set included rates of potentially avoidable hospitalization, which required a different set of questions about threats to validity than those used for patient safety metrics.<a name="back-bib22" href="#bib22"><sup>22</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib27" href="#bib27"><sup>27</sup></a> Given the changes in the measurement environment, future indicator assessments could also evaluate usefulness for pay-for-performance applications.</p>
<p class="indent">Of the 30 indicators in the AHRQ Quality Indicators that were potentially applicable to pediatrics, 18 indicators were selected for inclusion in the PDIs module.<a title="" href="#bib1" name="back-bib1"><sup>1</sup></a> Some were removed from consideration prior to panel review because of issues raised by empiric analyses. For example, pneumonia mortality is too rare in children to be used as a reliable measure. Input from users and unpublished chart reviews led to elimination of the failure-to-rescue indicator. Some indicators were eliminated or changed based on clinical panel review. The clinical review results for the final set of indicators are shown in <a title="" href="#tbl2" name="back-tbl2" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Table 2</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Selection is relative, in that an indicator set attempts to bring in the best indicators at the time that meet a reasonable level of credibility in response to the quality indicator validity framework (see <a title="" href="#fig3" name="back-fig3" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 3</a>). As indicator sets are made available, further research and actual use of the indicators provides additional data regarding validity. As shown in <a title="" href="#fig1" name="back-fig1" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 1</a>, this information also can feed back into the process of indicator refinement, may suggest potential revisions to the set as a whole, and expand knowledge for interpreting indicator results in practice. The AHRQ Quality Indicator program provides ongoing support and access to the research team (by way of e-mail to <a class="ja50-ce-inter-ref" href="mailto:www.support@qualityindicators.ahrq.gov" target="_blank">www.support@qualityindicators.ahrq.gov</a>), making technical assistance and this feedback loop seamless.</p>

<p id="lv_0007" class="level2">Application of the agency for healthcare research and quality pediatric quality indicators</p>
<p class="indent">An important early application of the AHRQ PDIs module is research.<a name="back-bib28" href="#bib28"><sup>28–30</sup></a> More in-depth study may guide appropriate use and interpretation. For example, NACHRI supported a chart review study of cases flagged by 11 indicators from the PDIs set at 76 children's hospitals. The study quantified the effect of missing information from the administrative data source about whether a complication of care was present on admission.<a title="" href="#bib27" name="back-bib27"><sup>27</sup></a> Three indicators had high rates of flagged cases present prior to the hospital admission: decubitis ulcer (40%), postoperative sepsis (40%), and selected infections caused by medical care (43%). With new requirements for hospital administrative data sets to distinguish whether a complication occurred during the hospital stay, and with modifications to the PDI software to use this information, the accuracy of finding cases of potentially preventable complications will improve. The study also examined the preventability of complications experienced by patients, calculating positive predictive values for finding preventable complications relative to all complications uncovered by the PDI (see <a title="" href="#tbl2" name="back-tbl2" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Table 2</a>). The assessment of preventability depends on the individual clinician evaluating the chart and the state of medical science at the time. A complication that is not preventable today may be amenable to strategies developed in the future to reduce its occurrence.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly to the NACHRI study, hospitals can run (or have another organization analyze) the entire PDIs set with their data to efficiently produce a subset of cases, and then drill down with chart review and additional data capture to guide quality improvement efforts. In the NACHRI review that started with 1.7 million hospitalizations, approximately 25,000 discharges (1.5%) were flagged for further study. Alternatively, a hospital quality program officer might use specific indicators that line up with particular quality improvement initiatives and monitor indicator results over time. These and other applications to quality improvement may benefit from comparison to national data on the PDIs, which are available by query from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Web site (<a class="ja50-ce-inter-ref" href="http://www.hcupnet.ahrq.gov" target="_blank">www.HCUPnet.ahrq.gov</a>).<a title="" href="#bib31" name="back-bib31"><sup>31</sup></a> Any comparative use of a quality indicator necessitates appropriate risk adjustment to the extent feasible with the given data source. The AHRQ PDIs have this capability built into the software.</p>

Rates have not changed much over the period, indicating opportunity for improvements in the future.</p>

<b>Fig. 5</b>   <span class="caption">Selected hospital-level AHRQ PDIs. The graph presents the risk-adjusted rates for six indicators from the AHRQ PDIs. All indicators rely on secondary diagnosis coding to count a complication of care for the numerator (after excluding patients in whom the complication is unlikely to be preventable to the extent feasible with administrative data) and use patients at risk for the complication as the denominator. For example, postoperative sepsis is defined as the number of patients who have sepsis (secondary diagnosis for septicemia, septic shock, inflammatory response attributable to infectious process, and so forth) per 1000 eligible admissions (all surgical patients aged 0–17 years, except with a principal diagnosis of sepsis or infection, neonates, and stays under 4 days).

<p class="indent">In addition to uses by researchers and hospitals, the PDIs are under review or already implemented in several state reports.<a name="back-bib32" href="#bib32"><sup>32</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib33" href="#bib33"><sup>33</sup></a> Some reports are not officially mandated and are made available by the research community, such as an analysis of 2005 state data for Tennessee of the five area-level PDIs that identify potentially avoidable pediatric hospitalizations (PAPH).<a title="" href="#bib34" name="back-bib34"><sup>34</sup></a> This report's application of the PDIs found 6725 PAPH discharges that cost hospitals a total of $17.6 million in 2005. Of note, the diabetes short-term complication rate was much higher than the national average, indicating a useful starting point for delving into potential barriers to high-quality primary care for those diabetic children who were hospitalized. Texas, like some other states, has ongoing mandates for comparative public reporting of hospital data. With the availability of the AHRQ PDIs, the Texas data organization considered potential inclusion of the indicators in its annual reports. A collaborative developed between hospitals and the state's representatives to anticipate and address each other's needs in the short- and long-range.<a title="" href="#bib35" name="back-bib35"><sup>35</sup></a> Selected AHRQ PDIs were incorporated and released at the end of 2007 and are available for comparison of hospitals.<a title="" href="#bib36" name="back-bib36"><sup>36</sup></a> Meanwhile, the collaborative is working toward incorporating other sources of data and indicators into public reports.<a title="" href="#bib35" name="back-bib35"><sup>35</sup></a> The ongoing challenge of these efforts is finding publicly available, clinically rich data collected in a standardized fashion in all relevant settings.</p>
<div id="sec5" />
<p id="lv_0008" class="level2">Challenges in indicator selection and use</p>
<p class="indent">As with the Texas experience and that of others, real stumbling blocks exist in selecting and using measures. If we wait for ideal data sources, then progress will be slow on the path toward quality improvement; however, in using data sources that are missing some of the information that would make assessments more meaningful, we risk misinterpretation. This risk can be mitigated if we consider the use of a particular measure and apply it appropriately, benefiting from the indicator's strengths and carefully accommodating its deficiencies.</p>
<p class="indent">Quality measurements are part of the diagnostic toolbox for understanding what ails the health care system at a given point in time. As with patient care, interpreting a diagnostic test result is a function of the likelihood of the patient having a disease and the performance characteristics of the test. We have mounting evidence about gaps in quality, and so measures that are “good enough” and not necessarily as high performing on sensitivity and specificity as we might ultimately want can move us toward directing quality improvement activities to good effect.</p>
<p class="indent">But thinking about any adverse consequences to treating prematurely or empirically in a given context merits careful consideration. If quality indicators are applied directly to quality improvement, then adverse consequences or overinspection of the indicators' shortcomings may distract providers from investigating and treating potential clinical and organizational sources of suboptimal care that could relate to the indicator finding, if true. Thus, the assumption that the indicator result is pointing to a deficiency could be followed up with an assessment about which interventions might reduce the likelihood of poor performance on the metric. Empiric therapy would result in implementing the interventions and seeing whether improvement in the indicator follows.</p>
<p class="indent">If the quality indicators are used for public comparative reporting, then adverse consequences of a false positive include patients choosing a hospital they think is better, when in fact it is not, and having a worse outcome from their care. In addition, the hospitals and care providers measured will expend lots of time and energy to support their credible claim that the measure is giving an incorrect reading on the actual quality delivered. Thus, public exposure argues for more robust measures and a good system of conveying the confidence interval reflecting the measurement error. If, however, comparative reporting is used in hospital consortiums and away from the public's eye, then the situation and thresholds for “good enough” measurement are more akin to those in the quality improvement application.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, measure use for reimbursement is becoming commonplace. This movement offers the possibility of rewarding systems and providers who offer the best quality of care. This newer territory, however, makes the need for high-fidelity measures more pressing. Potential adverse consequences of using less refined measures depend on the specific deficiencies in measurement and the particular circumstance but could include (1) changing practice behavior to avoid taking care of sicker patients (eg, “cherry-picking”) if risk adjustment is inadequate, (2) giving less attention to that which is not measured but may be vital clinically, and (3) moving the focus to the measures as opposed to the actual care of the children and support of their families. As with other applications, the issue is not only the measurement's performance characteristics but also what steps are taken on the basis of results from the measure. Even pay-for-performance could use less developed measures if the initial results were followed by careful audits and efforts to supplement the data and analysis to assure fairness.</p>
<div id="sec6" />
<p id="lv_0009" class="level2">Summary</p>
<p class="indent">With a large pipeline of measures for potential NQF endorsement, with the recent developments to not pay for some iatrogenic complications (for Medicare patients), and with public knowledge about quality variation, measures are here to stay. They can cause some distress, given the exposure of both accurate and inaccurate findings about quality of care. The pediatric field has some advantages compared with the adult counterpart, as it enters more deeply into measurement territory. The smaller number of patients makes the world of pediatrics cozier and potentially more collaborative, and more lessons are available from the intense scrutiny in the adult-care arena. These factors offer an opportunity to the pediatrics community to view the development and application of measures from the perspective of an evolutionary process of continuous quality improvement. Past history has shown that criticism of measures will not obviate the need for this vital tool for quality improvement. Instead, critiques can make the measures better. Within this context, measures and their uses are best approached the same way we think about quality itself—through a continuous cycle of improvement.</p>
