At the same time, there must be a firm belief that better care also makes good business sense. Improvement initiatives have been shown to reduce costs, increase demand, promote more efficient use of scarce hospital resources, generate higher margins, and offer families improved overall value. For example, the authors found that, on average, the length of stay for each patient who had a preventable surgical site infection is increased by 10.6 days (15.0 days versus 4.4 days for children who do not develop a surgical site infection);<ce:cross-ref refid="bib14"><ce:sup>14</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> avoiding these infections would have resulted in an additional 1 million dollars per year in revenue through increased bed capacity for other patients.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec7"><ce:section-title>Engaging patients and families</ce:section-title><ce:para>The patient and family as the locus of control is key to transformation.

To sustain progress and accelerate the pace of cultural change, however, it is important to rapidly increase the number of individuals who have expertise in leading and executing improvement initiatives. To accomplish this, hospitals need to develop their own intermediate and advanced improvement programs to prepare staff to execute and teach improvement science and to lead improvement teams. For academic institutions, the use of improvement science methods, including planned experimentation, factorial designs, and control charts to understand common and special-cause variation, is critical.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib17"><ce:sup>17</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> When quality improvement is not fully embraced as a science, discipline and will can be lost and coalitions can degrade. Integrating improvement science with pediatric residency programs and establishing a quality improvement fellowship program are vital to ensuring that the next generation of clinicians has the quality improvement knowledge and skills to improve care delivery and patient outcomes.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec10"><ce:section-title>Reliability and standardization</ce:section-title><ce:para>In health care, reliability is defined as the measurable capability of a process, procedure, or health service to perform its intended function in the required time, under commonly occurring conditions.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib12"><ce:sup>12</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> Weick and colleagues<ce:cross-ref refid="bib18"><ce:sup>18</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> identified five characteristics common to organizations that practice high reliability.

The principles of reliability science can be used to prevent failures, to identify and mitigate the impact of failures that inevitably occur, and to redesign the system to prevent future failures.<ce:cross-refs refid="bib17 bib19"><ce:sup>17,19</ce:sup></ce:cross-refs></ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec11"><ce:section-title>Reliability examples from cincinnati children&apos;s hospital medical center</ce:section-title><ce:para>The following examples demonstrate how this framework for transformation can be used to improve safety (such as reducing surgical site infections and ventilator-associated pneumonias [VAPs]) and to achieve highly reliable delivery of evidence-based care for common, important conditions.

The system-level measure is a composite measure of the percentage of patients receiving care according to evidence-based guideline recommendations for five common conditions (bronchiolitis, acute gastroenteritis, fever of uncertain source, acute exacerbation of asthma, and community-acquired pneumonia). The leadership champion for two teams (one in the emergency department and one for inpatient care) is the chief of staff, a practicing physician. A quality improvement consultant and a data analyst provide 1 to 1.5 days of support each week. The goal is to improve the reliability of care delivery and to achieve 95% compliance with guideline recommendations.</ce:para><ce:para>The most fundamental step toward high reliability is standardizing key processes and decision making.

The clinical protocol gave nurses and respiratory therapists permission to administer appropriate evidence-based recommendations for guideline-eligible patients. No physician order was required to initiate the protocol; of note, a physician order was necessary if the protocol was not followed. Thus, the desired action was the default. The second intervention designated a charge nurse to identify guideline-eligible patients each shift. When a guideline-eligible patient did not receive care according to the guideline recommendations, the nurse identified the cause and attempted to remedy or mitigate the situation by speaking with the staff or physician assigned to the patient, thus identifying and preventing a potential error. The composite measure of compliance increased to 92% with the &ldquo;identify and mitigate&rdquo; strategy, with sustained results.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec11.2"><ce:section-title>Reducing Ventilator-associated Pneumonias</ce:section-title><ce:para>The system-level priority is improving patient safety.

Improving national system-level measures will require each hospital to pursue its own transformation journey and, at the same time, collaborate across hospitals and other organizations. To maximize success, the following issues need to be addressed: (1) creating a sense of urgency for improvement and raising the level of collective accountability for improving quality measures at the national level,<ce:cross-ref refid="bib25"><ce:sup>25</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> (2) providing leadership for improvement at the board, senior-leadership, and management levels, (3) enhancing improvement capability and capacity, (4) increasing the level of patient and parent engagement, (5) documenting the business case for quality, and (6) pursuing a supportive policy environment.</ce:para><ce:para>Aligning efforts across organizations committed to quality and transformation is essential. An example of an integrating force in this regard at the national level is the Alliance for Pediatric Quality<ce:cross-ref refid="bib26"><ce:sup>26</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref>, a collaboration among the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Board of Pediatrics, the Child Health Corporation of America, and the National Association of Children&apos;s Hospitals and Related Institutions. A high-priority focus for the Alliance for Pediatric Quality is to raise the level of collective accountability for achieving near-perfection, transformational goals by defining a core set of national quality measures for pediatric care. Recognizing the complexity involved with establishing national system-level measures and near-perfection goals, the Alliance for Pediatric Quality can build on other national quality measurement development efforts (eg, the National Initiative for Children&apos;s Healthcare Quality, the Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative, the National Quality Forum, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Joint Commission, the Ambulatory Quality Alliance, the Hospital Quality Alliance, and the American Medical Association Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement). Potential system-level measures for assessing the quality of hospital-based care for children across the United States are shown in <ce:cross-ref refid="tbl3">Table 3</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="tbl3"/>.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib4"><ce:sup>4</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref></ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec13"><ce:section-title>Creating urgency: the need to go public</ce:section-title><ce:para>A sense of urgency that is shared among providers, patients and families, and policymakers is essential to successful transformation at the national level.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib10"><ce:sup>10</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> This sense of urgency can be created by establishing a core set of measures that document the current state of quality of care within and across hospitals caring for children. Hospitals can proactively embrace this opportunity to take the lead in establishing the &ldquo;national scorecard&rdquo; and can communicate progress achieved in improving the system-level measures to various stakeholder groups, including the public-at-large, purchasers, payors, and government entities. Strong leadership from the Alliance for Pediatric Quality and each hospital is essential to documenting the current state of quality and will entail at least the following steps: (1) supporting standardized reporting among hospitals, (2) establishing a centralized data source to support comparative performance reporting and to meet private- and public-sector reporting requirements, and (3) committing to internal and external transparency of aggregate and comparative hospital data. Transparency will have a powerful effect in elevating the level of collective accountability for quality of care at the national level; in addition, the variation in comparative performance will fundamentally change the nature of how hospitals learn from each other and interact at all levels (eg, board, senior management, frontline care givers, parents/patients).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec14"><ce:section-title>Supportive public policy environment</ce:section-title><ce:para>Hospitals providing pediatric care are dramatically improving quality and safety, but these efforts would be greatly enhanced by a far more supportive policy environment. Although this is true for improvement initiatives for all populations, it is particularly salient for children due to the heavy reliance on publicly financed care (eg, Medicaid and the State Child Health Insurance Program [SCHIP]). The necessary federal and state authority and the attendant improvement capacity in terms of staff, expertise, and resources within Medicaid and SCHIP are insufficient compared to Medicare.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib27"><ce:sup>27</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> Although some progress can be made under current rules, congressional action is needed to provide these authorities and resources to Medicaid and SCHIP.
