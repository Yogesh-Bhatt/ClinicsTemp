<p class="indent1">Health information technology (HIT) will play an important role in most efforts to improve the quality of pediatric medicine, as evident from the range of investigations and projects discussed in this volume. The importance of using information technology as an integral component of quality initiatives was identified early in the development of electronic medical records (EMR) in the classic paper by Clement McDonald, “Protocol-Based Computer Reminders, the Quality of Care and the Non-Perfectability of Man,”<a title="" href="#bib1" name="back-bib1"><sup>1</sup></a> That paper, published in 1976, demonstrated the need for computerized reminders in a crossover study in an internal medicine clinic. The role of HIT in quality improvement is not limited to tools integrated into EMR, but that remains an important strategy. Today, much attention is focused on interoperability of clinical systems that integrate and share data from multiple sources. There are also additional freestanding quality-improvement tools that can be used without an EMR. This article explores the many roles of HIT in quality improvement from several perspectives.</p>
<div id="sec2" />
<p id="lv_0004" class="level2">Identifying roles for health information technology within the Institute of Medicine definition of quality</p>
<p class="indent">In its 2001 report, <i>Crossing the Quality Chasm</i>, the Institute of Medicine set forward a six-part definition of quality and closely aligned each dimension of quality to the use of HIT.<a title="" href="#bib2" name="back-bib2"><sup>2</sup></a> Since that time, several pediatric investigators, most recently Spooner,<a title="" href="#bib3" name="back-bib3"><sup>3</sup></a> have expanded on this framework and illustrated its application. While it is easy to see how information technology directly affects safety, effectiveness, timeliness, and efficiency of care, the dimensions of equity and patient-centeredness are more elusive and harder to illustrate in meeting the quality-assurance needs of children. Equity is best represented as the use of HIT to reduce health disparities in children. Patient-centeredness represents the task of delivering patient care in the context of the patient's family and values. This has long been a quality goal for pediatric practice and an essential component of a medical home.<a title="" href="#bib4" name="back-bib4"><sup>4</sup></a> In 2009, a new report in the Institute of Medicine <i>Quality Chasm</i> series, <i>Computational Technology for Effective Health Care: Immediate Steps and Strategic Directions,</i> raises the challenge of “crossing the health care IT chasm” and creates a vision for twenty-first century health care and wellness through patient-centered cognitive support.<a title="" href="#bib5" name="back-bib5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<div id="sec3" />
<p id="lv_0005" class="level2">Functional strategies for quality improvement</p>
<p class="indent">Functional strategies separate systems that play an active, passive, or reporting role in quality improvement. A primary role of HIT is to help visualize data in an EMR. Documentation of care is often the focus of information system design. But attention should also be given to improving access to information in the record by making information more readily available and displaying that information in a way that can be understood quickly to support informed decision-making in a time-constrained patient-care environment. An important strategy for visualization is to aggregate and integrate data from multiple sources through interoperability among computer systems. Evaluation of growth and obesity, for example, is facilitated by extraction of all growth measurements and graphical display.<a title="" href="#bib6" name="back-bib6"><sup>6</sup></a> This function is more effective if measurements from other practices are combined with data in the current record. Complete immunization histories can be assembled by immunization registries<a title="" href="#bib7" name="back-bib7"><sup>7</sup></a> and aggregated medication histories are available through prescription benefit claims histories and data exchange among the inpatient, emergency, and ambulatory settings. Computer systems that deliver content and guidelines to the point of care assist quality improvement by integrating visualization of patient data with expert- and evidence-based guidelines. The Health Level 7 (HL7) information buttons enable integration of these external links into electronic record applications.</p>
<p class="indent">Systems that provide active clinical decision support represent a key goal for HIT and a national strategy and roadmap has been proposed by American Medical Informatics Association.<a title="" href="#bib8" name="back-bib8"><sup>8</sup></a> Such decision support may involve simple reminders for tasks that the clinician must perform or specific computer-generated orders and plans of care that can be implemented with a single click. Alternative HIT architectures for clinical decision support include self-contained decision-support modules used on the clinician's workstation or through access to a Web site. Interoperable clinical guidelines distribute decision logic using a rule-writing syntax, such as the Arden Syntax or GuideLine Implementability Appraisal,<a title="" href="#bib9" name="back-bib9"><sup>9</sup></a> that allows the EHR to run the rules on individual patient records at the time of care and generate advice that can be implemented during the visit. Because of the complexity and variability of decision-support requirements, focus has shifted to interoperable clinical data formats and Web services that separate the patient-care activities of the clinician (who may use a variety of computer systems) from the decision-support activities that can be performed at a central site independent of the site of patient care. Use of centralized Web-based decision support requires the use of deidentified data so that only the responsible clinician knows the patient identification and the decision recommendations. The development of the HL7 Decision Support Service<a title="" href="#bib10" name="back-bib10"><sup>10</sup></a> has created a framework for this type of Web service, which has the potential to make decision support widely available. It eliminates the need for each vendor or each health care institution to develop its own version of the same decision-support tool because data from diverse systems and organizations can share a single provider of decision support. Immunization forecasting (reviewing the vaccine history to assess what additional vaccines are required or recommended) has been one of the greatest decision-support needs for children and also has been a very complex task to implement in multiple environments. Through the work of Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise, standard profiles for sending immunization data<a title="" href="#bib11" name="back-bib11"><sup>11</sup></a> are now available and standard Web services are under development that can be shared by multiple EHR vendors and provided by multiple decision-support providers.</p>
<p class="indent">The newest role for HIT is to extract data for external quality reporting by providing an automated alternative to manual chart review. This task is most challenging because quality measures are more complex than the types of chart abstraction tools used for clinical research chart review. Many quality measures are population based and call for reports of percentages of children receiving appropriate services. Many others are time based and seek to identify status and outcomes at a point following initial diagnosis or treatment. Exclusion and inclusion criteria must be considered and some may require a minimal sample size. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Quality Forum are working to develop templates for automating chart review and quality reporting. The needs of children must be included.<a title="" href="#bib12" name="back-bib12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<div id="sec4" />
<p id="lv_0006" class="level2">Types of health information technology tools for quality improvement</p>
<p class="indent">Tools that are integrated into an EMR have become the standard approach to the use of HIT at the point of care, but other approaches should be considered. Tools that provide interoperability among information systems address the task of aggregating and assembling data for quality care decisions. Such tools are important in the care of children because of the need to monitor longitudinal data and be aware of events in other provider settings, particularly when a child is not accompanied by the parent who may have brought the child to an emergency room or to another encounter. Tools that are freestanding and used separately from the process of documenting care, are important because of the low EHR adoption rate in pediatrics.<a title="" href="#bib13" name="back-bib13"><sup>13</sup></a> Freestanding quality assurance is usually performed with Web-based tools and applications for mobile or handheld devices, such as cell phones and personal digital assistants. The mobile Internet browser on a cell phone is merging the two technologies of handheld applications and Web access in a single device. Tools for data mining and information discovery can use practice records to seek evidence for quality initiatives, evaluate specific needs of a practice for quality improvement, and generate patient-specific reminders for deficiencies, such as missing immunizations or screening tests. The use of service-oriented architecture (SOA) or Web services is an important strategy for sending patient data to a Web service that reviews the data and returns assessments and advice. SOA can also be used as a strategy to extract specific data elements from a practice information system through queries that select patients and return only the information needed for quality measurement or improvement, thus protecting patient privacy by excluding data not needed for the current analysis.</p>

<p id="lv_0007" class="level2">Federal strategies for using health information technology for quality improvement</p>
<p class="indent">The Decade of Health Information, which began with the executive order creating the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology on April 27, 2004, has a 10-year goal for computerizing medical records for most Americans.<a title="" href="#bib14" name="back-bib14"><sup>14</sup></a> It was inspired by “Revolutionizing Health Care Through Information Technology,”<a title="" href="#bib15" name="back-bib15"><sup>15</sup></a> a report of the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee, and a later report, “Ending the Document Game,” from the Congressional Commission on Systemic Interoperability.<a title="" href="#bib16" name="back-bib16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The federal strategy for using HIT for quality improvement, articulated through the strategic plans of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, involves a five-step process: (1) setting priorities for breakthroughs or transformations in health care than can be achieved through use of HIT, (2) development and harmonization of standards, (3) certification of EHR based on use of standard criteria, (4) creation of the Nationwide Health Information Network, and (5) monitoring of implementation and adoption. Throughout this process, attention is also given to protection of privacy of personal health information and to governance of networks and information exchange with goals of improving transparency of information while improving safety, increasing effectiveness, and reducing cost through quality improvement.</p>
<p class="indent">The setting of priorities began with the American Health Information Community and its workgroups and is now moving to successor organizations and advisory committees. The Health Information Standards Panel<a title="" href="#bib17" name="back-bib17"><sup>17</sup></a> has been responsible for standards harmonization and the Commission for Certification of Health Information Technology<a title="" href="#bib18" name="back-bib18"><sup>18</sup></a> has been the certification body. Several trial implementations of the Nationwide Health Information Network have demonstrated the breakthrough priorities in a variety of communities.<a title="" href="#bib19" name="back-bib19"><sup>19</sup></a> Many federal agencies have played a role in using HIT for quality improvement in children. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality<a title="" href="#bib20" name="back-bib20"><sup>20</sup></a> has funded a range of related projects, called Transforming Healthcare Quality Through Information Technology, and the Health Resources and Services Administration<a title="" href="#bib21" name="back-bib21"><sup>21</sup></a> has developed an HIT Toolkit to assist community health center networks in deploying HIT to improve quality. The National Institutes of Health has launched several translational research network projects to gather evidence for quality improvement, including the Newborn Screening Translational Research Network.<a title="" href="#bib22" name="back-bib22"><sup>22</sup></a> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has established the Public Health Information Network and provides important child health data on its Web site.<a title="" href="#bib23" name="back-bib23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">A review of activities from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology shows that use cases initiated under the federal HIT initiatives cover a wide range of quality-improvement targets:<a title="" href="#bib24" name="back-bib24"><sup>24</sup></a><span class="ja50-ce-list"><span class="list-item"><span class="list-item-content">Consumer Empowerment: Registration &amp; Medication History<span class="ja50-ce-list"><span class="list-item"><span class="list-item-content">This is a core summary record that transfers critical data from a personal health record or another EHR that might otherwise come from a waiting room clipboard and allows updates at each visit.

<p id="lv_0008" class="level2">State strategies for using health information technology for pediatric quality improvement</p>
<p class="indent">State strategies for using HIT for quality improvement are of special importance to children because of the role states have in controlling Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Programs and in integrating quality monitoring requirements into those programs. In October 2008, the State Alliance for e-Health issued its first report to the nation, <i>Accelerating Progress: Using Health Information Technology and Electronic Health Information Exchange to Improve Care</i>.<a title="" href="#bib27" name="back-bib27"><sup>27</sup></a> The report addresses recommendations on the state role in using HIT and health information exchange, including making a patient-centered, interoperable, and portable EHR available for every child by 2014. Medicaid Transformation Grant Programs have the potential to support new quality initiative infrastructures for children and many focus on improving data integration among diverse systems for Early and Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment programs, immunization registries, and lead screening. School health programs represent another opportunity for quality improvement outside of conventional practice settings. Payer strategies for using HIT for pediatric quality improvement are often referred to as pay for performance. Projects within state Medicaid programs also have private-sector counterparts that may share criteria. Consumer strategies for using HIT for pediatric quality improvement include personal health records and efforts to improve transparency of quality and cost though health value exchanges.</p>
<p class="indent">Health information exchange strategies for using HIT for pediatric quality improvement may include placing HIT in practices so they can communicate with each other. The New York City Department of Health has installed electronic health records in over 1000 practices. MassShare, the state-level health information exchange for Massachusetts, is engaged in similar community-wide HIT implementations.</p>
<p class="indent">Section 1139A(d)(1)(D) and 1139A(f) of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 calls for a project to demonstrate the impact of a model EHR format for children as part of quality measures for child health. This format will “allow interoperable exchanges that conform with Federal and State privacy and security requirements,” will be “structured in a manner that permits parents and caregivers to view and understand the extent to which the care their children receive is clinically appropriate and of high quality,” and will be “capable of being incorporated into, and otherwise compatible with, other standards developed for electronic health records.” Newborn screening and newborn hospital discharge summaries could be a foundational component.</p>
<div id="sec7" />
<p id="lv_0009" class="level2">Private sector strategies for using health information technology for pediatric quality improvement</p>
<p class="indent">The private sector has also developed strategies for using HIT for pediatric quality improvement through initiatives of professional societies and the work of organizations that advocate for the health of children. The Alliance for Pediatric Quality brings together several professional societies working on quality care for children.<a title="" href="#bib28" name="back-bib28"><sup>28</sup></a> The American Academy of Pediatrics Partnership for Policy Implementation seeks to create computable guidelines that will allow HIT to be mobilized to implement guidelines for care.<a title="" href="#bib29" name="back-bib29"><sup>29</sup></a> The special pediatric requirements for use of HIT have been well articulated in a policy statement from American Academy of Pediatrics<a title="" href="#bib30" name="back-bib30"><sup>30</sup></a> and in the HL7 EHR functional model for children. Children's hospitals have played an important role in advancing the use of HIT for quality improvement and also in providing personal health records for the children they serve to help maintain continuity of care among children with special needs and chronic diseases.<a title="" href="#bib31" name="back-bib31"><sup>31</sup></a> The use of HIT to reduce health disparities in children remains a frontier where HIT may be able to exert a leveling influence to improve quality and health outcomes.</p>
<div id="sec8" />
<p id="lv_0010" class="level2">Disaster preparedness and using health information technology for pediatric quality improvement</p>
<p class="indent">Experiences of children following Hurricane Katrina have created a new awareness of the vulnerability of children.<a title="" href="#bib32" name="back-bib32"><sup>32</sup></a> The disruption of newborn screening programs and management of children with genetic disorders is a problem that HIT might address by helping to maintain continuity of services. The joint policy on emergency information forms for children with special needs developed jointly by The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Emergency Medicine should be applied to all children. Forms are available on the Web and families are encouraged to keep these forms available when emergency care is needed. HIT can address this need and improve transfer of data from electronic records.</p>
<div id="sec9" />
<p id="lv_0011" class="level2">On the horizon</p>
<p class="indent">On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed the economic stimulus package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which provides $19 billion for health care information technology. The funds will be Medicare and Medicaid incentives for the adoption of the EHR and support for health information exchanges, EHR adoption, and other HIT efforts that depend on the evolving definition of “Meaningful Use“.<a title="" href="#bib33" name="back-bib33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<div id="sec10" />
<p id="lv_0012" class="level2">Summary</p>
<p class="indent">HIT holds great promise for supporting quality-improvement efforts in pediatrics. Activities will continue to include a variety of strategies to make more data available when care decisions are made, to make guidelines on appropriate care available at the point of care, to automate the decision process and reminder process through clinical decision support, and to monitor the need for targeted intervention through quality reporting. Quality-improvement and monitoring activities based on the use of paper charts are resource intensive and can reach only a limited population. The use of HIT tools for quality improvement can integrate quality improvement into routine care for all children and make continuous quality improvement feasible.</p>
