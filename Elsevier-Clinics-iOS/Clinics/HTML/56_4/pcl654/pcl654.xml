Because of the paucity of evidence supporting pediatric practice, many comparative performance reports are based on provider consensus about what is important to know and measure. After describing provider performance, the critical next step is deciding what to do with that information. Because most providers are not trained in the science and practice of quality improvement, quality improvement networks/learning collaboratives/communities of practice play an essential role in disseminating the knowledge, tools, and techniques of quality improvement and in helping to actually implement improvement plans.</ce:para><ce:section id="sec2.1"><ce:section-title>Comparative Neonatal ICU Hospital-Acquired Bloodstream Infection Performance Reports: How are We Doing? Do We Have a Problem?</ce:section-title><ce:para>Imagine you work at the hospital represented by the bold dot in <ce:cross-ref refid="fig1">Fig.&nbsp;1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig1"/>. The display plots NICU nosocomial sepsis infection (NI) outcomes for several hundred hospitals participating in the Vermont Oxford Network.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib5"><ce:sup>5</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> Each dot represents the difference between the number of positive blood cultures in infants after day 3 of life reported by an individual hospital and the number that would be expected at that hospital after accounting for specific differences in patient characteristics&mdash;case mix&mdash;from hospital to hospital. Additionally, the dots reflect so-called &ldquo;shrunken&rdquo; estimates: a method that accounts for the assumption that one infant&apos;s infection is not independent of another&apos;s, and adjusts for individual hospital estimates considered relatively imprecise by moving such values closer to the mean value for all hospitals. So, how is your facility doing with these hospital-acquired infections (HAIs)? Do you have a problem with this aspect of care?</ce:para><ce:para>Displays as this one may appear pretty straightforward at first glance; but only at first glance. Each dot encodes the result of a complex analysis that rests upon crucial assumptions and important limitations. Tempting as it may be immediately to articulate the &ldquo;answer&rdquo; provided by a given dot, for several reasons, an impulsive determination is fraught with risk. First, the answer represented by each dot depends on the question posed&mdash;the hypothesis tested. Second, meaningful and fair comparison of various institutions&apos; results depends on accounting for baseline patient characteristics that importantly influence the outcome of interest but that are independent of quality of care. Third, valid results depend on an analysis that conforms to methodological assumptions. And fourth, correctly drawn inference integrates these three considerations with explicit assessment of residual chance, bias, or confounding.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib6"><ce:sup>6</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> Let&apos;s explore some of these ideas further before we decide what the bold dot tells us about clinical performance.</ce:para><ce:section id="sec2.1.1"><ce:section-title>Are the comparisons fair?</ce:section-title><ce:para>At the outset, it is worth discriminating at least two different and important uses for quality improvement data:<ce:list><ce:list-item><ce:label>(1)</ce:label><ce:para>Data for improvement, which do not support operationally specific inferences (concrete ideas about what to do differently) to the extent we might like, but the data nonetheless can inspire hypotheses about how to improve; and then those hypotheses must be tested.</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item><ce:label>(2)</ce:label><ce:para>Data for accountability/external comparisons. These data are made public. They ought to support operationally specific inference and be as reliable and valid, as possible; ie, providers must believe the data.</ce:para></ce:list-item></ce:list></ce:para><ce:para>Although the authors consider perfect risk adjustment in the NICU an impractical ideal, it is reasonable to compare performance as a means to seek opportunities for internal improvement&hellip;not external accountability.</ce:para><ce:para>It is crucial to appreciate that accounting for specified baseline differences among individual group members, for example, patients in various hospitals, doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that groups&mdash;hospitals&mdash;are being compared fairly. Some exposure/outcome relationships may be distorted when the outcome is also substantially affected by <ce:italic>un</ce:italic>accounted differences among individual group members. More concretely, the relationship between receiving care in a particular facility (primary exposure) and risk of developing an HAI (outcome) can change when other baseline differences&mdash;risk factors, secondary exposures&mdash;are included in the analysis. To illustrate, let&apos;s compare the incidence of HAI in imaginary NICU A and NICU B (<ce:cross-ref refid="tbl1">Table 1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="tbl1"/>). The risk ratio (RR) for developing an HAI in NICU A compared with NICU B is 1.5 when all subjects are considered: ie, patients in NICU A are at 50% increased risk of developing an HAI compared with patients in NICU B. However, when only males or only females are considered, the RR is 1 (no risk difference). How can an apparently strong exposure effect disappear when we stratify by gender?</ce:para><ce:para>At the heart of this question is a phenomenon called Simpson&apos;s Paradox. The RR of 1.5 among all subjects disappears when analysis is stratified by gender because gender is associated with both primary exposure&mdash;the NICU in which a patient receives care, and with outcome&mdash;HAI. No real association exists between primary exposure and outcome. Rather, the association is between <ce:italic>secondary</ce:italic> exposure&mdash;<ce:italic>gender</ce:italic>&mdash;and outcome. The apparent relationship reflects unequal distribution of males and females in NICU A and NICU B. The point to underscore is that each analysis answered a different question:<ce:list><ce:list-item><ce:label>&bull;</ce:label><ce:para>&ldquo;Among the <ce:bold>entire</ce:bold> study group, what is the association between primary exposure and outcome?&rdquo;</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item><ce:label>&bull;</ce:label><ce:para>&ldquo;Among the <ce:bold>males</ce:bold> in the study group, what is the association between primary exposure and outcome?&rdquo;</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item><ce:label>&bull;</ce:label><ce:para>&ldquo;Among the <ce:bold>females</ce:bold> in the study group, what is the association between primary exposure and outcome?&rdquo;</ce:para></ce:list-item></ce:list></ce:para><ce:para>So, if apparent exposure/outcome relationships can change as additional factors are accounted for, <ce:italic>how does one gain confidence that an exposure/outcome relationship is real</ce:italic>&mdash;<ce:italic>that the important factors have indeed been accounted for?</ce:italic> The key idea is that patients at different hospitals may differ in various ways and some of those differences might substantially explain observed variation in outcomes among hospitals. In general, meaningful comparisons ultimately entail comparing like with like. So metaphorically speaking, the problem of comparing hospital performance centers on this question: &ldquo;If asked to evaluate several bowls of fruit salad, how does one transform the diversity into a comparison of apples with apples?&rdquo;</ce:para><ce:para>Statisticians try to achieve this via so-called risk adjustment methods. Sometimes the magic works very well and other times we are left still comparing apples with oranges, pears, and so on. Several measures exist to quantify how well a risk adjustment model has achieved the desired result.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib7"><ce:sup>7</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> Clinicians should understand at least two of these. (We emphasize that critical review is not intended to create an &ldquo;excuse&rdquo; for taking no action. An analytical review may be critical yet constructive by enumerating potential limitations along with speculating about the direction and magnitude of potential bias.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib8"><ce:sup>8</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> For example, in light of the identified limitations perhaps the findings represent an overestimate (or underestimate) of the effect of site of care on outcome. On the other hand, if such review suggests that the <ce:italic>direction</ce:italic> of the relationship could be different, then it may indeed be appropriate to suspend action until better data are available.)</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec2.1.2"><ce:section-title>Evaluating a risk adjustment model</ce:section-title><ce:para>One measure of model performance is discriminatory power: how well a model, on the basis of specified baseline characteristics, discriminates subjects who will experience the outcome from those who will not. Discriminatory power may be quantified as the area under a plot of model sensitivity versus 1-specificity: the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig2">Fig.&nbsp;2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig2"/>).<ce:cross-ref refid="bib9"><ce:sup>9</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> Values range from 0 to 1: 0.5 &equals; random outcome assignment (coin toss); 1 &equals; perfect discrimination. The <ce:italic>c</ce:italic>-statistic, using the same range of values, quantifies discriminatory power by evaluating all pairs of subjects, one of whom experienced the outcome and one of whom did not; and evaluates the proportion of pairs for whom the model correctly predicts higher probability of experiencing the outcome for the subject who actually experienced the outcome.</ce:para><ce:para>A second model performance measure is explanatory power: the extent to which the model can explain the observed variation in outcome among subjects. Models use observed values to produce an equation summarizing the risk factor/outcome relationship. This equation predicts outcome values expected for a given profile of risk factor values; thereby describing a line. In reality, however, <ce:italic>observed</ce:italic> values don&apos;t fall precisely on the prediction line.</ce:para><ce:para>More specifically, models predicting a dichotomous outcome&mdash;yes/no; lived/died; infection/infection-free&mdash;assign a predicted probability of outcome occurrence to each individual subject based on that subject&apos;s risk factor values. Now, probabilities range from 0 to 1, but patients either experience the outcome or do not, so observed values are all either 0 or 1 (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig3">Fig.&nbsp;3</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig3"/>). Thus, observations off the line described by the predictive equation contain information that the model could not use. In general, the extent to which a model could use the observed information is measured by a quantity called R<ce:sup>2</ce:sup>, or explanatory power. Theoretical R<ce:sup>2</ce:sup> values range between 0 (no association between predicted and observed values) and 1 (perfect association). The extent to which a model could <ce:italic>not</ce:italic> use information contained in the observations is measured by 1 &minus; R<ce:sup>2</ce:sup>, also called unexplained variance. The latter represents the contribution of unmeasured factors to the observed variance. So if R<ce:sup>2</ce:sup> &equals; 0.16, the model fails to explain 84% of observed variance. For dichotomous outcomes, R<ce:sup>2</ce:sup> reflects the difference between average predicted outcome probability among those who experienced the outcome and those who did not,<ce:cross-ref refid="bib8"><ce:sup>8</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> and commonly is reported as pseudo R<ce:sup>2</ce:sup>. Models that account well for determinants of an infrequently occurring outcome nonetheless will have a low pseudo R<ce:sup>2</ce:sup>. For example, when observed infection rate is 2% to 4%, pseudo R<ce:sup>2</ce:sup> is usually less than 0.25, because the difference between the predicted and observed values commonly is large. (Robust severity adjustment systems do not exist for much of pediatrics, so we need to accept imperfect risk adjustment and move forward because ultimately improvement means comparing self to self over time; if the patient population in a given NICU stays fairly similar over time then that comparison is reasonable. However, we do need agreement on operational definitions such as how to diagnose a central line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or whether &ldquo;clinical sepsis&rdquo; is to be included in the definition. Voltaire made the essential point: &ldquo;the best is the enemy of the good.&rdquo;)<ce:cross-ref refid="bib7"><ce:sup>7</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> One upshot of this is that detecting a change in occurrence rate for infrequent events requires both a large sample size and substantial change in risk. For example, if baseline occurrence rate is 1%, 747 subjects with the risk factor of interest and 747 subjects without that factor are needed to detect a threefold increased risk.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib10"><ce:sup>10</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref></ce:para><ce:para>Explained and unexplained variance are crucial ideas because some organizations consider unexplained variance a surrogate for &ldquo;quality.&rdquo; That is, outcome differences remaining among hospitals after risk adjustment are considered to reflect care at the respective hospital. Doing so rests on two important assumptions:<ce:list><ce:list-item><ce:label>1.</ce:label><ce:para>No other factors that are independent of quality of care operate to substantially influence the relationship between site of care and outcome. That is, one is unable to think of other baseline patient characteristics that might have a substantial effect on the outcome. If otherwise, those other factors should be included in the model to provide reassurance that exposure/outcome relationships nevertheless remain stable.</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item><ce:label>2.</ce:label><ce:para>An unimportant proportion of the remaining variance is due to chance. The smaller the explanatory power and the larger the unexplained variance, the larger the potential contributions of irrelevant information and random error to the model; and therefore the more tenuous the inference about quality.</ce:para></ce:list-item></ce:list></ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec2.1.3"><ce:section-title>&ldquo;Shrunken&rdquo; estimates: multilevel risk adjustment models</ce:section-title><ce:para>One more type of special accounting merits further explanation to help decipher the message of the bold dot in <ce:cross-ref refid="fig1">Fig.&nbsp;1</ce:cross-ref>: so-called &ldquo;shrunken&rdquo; estimates. Traditional risk adjustment methods assume that observations are independent of each other; for example, that a hospital-acquired infection in one patient has nothing to do with such an event in another patient in the same facility. However, what happens to one patient may not be independent of what happens to another patient in the same facility. Factors that predispose one patient to an outcome may also operate to predispose other patients to that outcome. Outcomes may be correlated: systematic differences unexplained by specified predictors may exist among hospitals. (Quality improvement is often based on understanding systemic factors as a root cause to differential performance, eg, hand hygiene rates may impact many outcomes and may be performed at very different rates by different members of the staff at different units. Other examples include presence of a PICC team; average length of time the nursing staff has worked in a given unit; having a dedicated catheter cart; who has responsibility for PICCs, housestaff versus nurse practitioners; parents&apos; hand hygiene compliance rates.) One must therefore account for the varying roles of individual-level and group-level factors in jointly determining outcomes. This may be done via multilevel modeling, which yields &ldquo;shrunken&rdquo; outcome estimates. The predicted result for an individual hospital tends to &ldquo;shrink,&rdquo; away from the hospital&apos;s observed value toward the value of the summary measure for all hospitals. How much a hospital&apos;s predicted value shrinks depends on three criteria for assessing the reliability of a particular hospital&apos;s observed result:<ce:list><ce:list-item><ce:label>1.</ce:label><ce:para><ce:italic>Within-group variation</ce:italic>: How much do individual patients&apos; values differ from the hospital&apos;s average outcome?</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item><ce:label>2.</ce:label><ce:para><ce:italic>Between-group variation</ce:italic>: To what extent does each hospital differ from the average for all hospitals?</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item><ce:label>3.</ce:label><ce:para><ce:italic>Patient volume</ce:italic>: Low-volume hospitals are considered a relatively less reliable data source.</ce:para></ce:list-item></ce:list></ce:para><ce:para>Reliability here relates to the extent an observed value may have been affected by chance events and not the system of care. When an individual hospital&apos;s observations seem less reliable, the model assigns less weight to that hospital&apos;s observed outcomes and more weight to the overall experience of all hospitals.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec2.1.4"><ce:section-title>So, how are we doing?</ce:section-title><ce:para>We are now prepared to extract the message of <ce:cross-ref refid="fig1">Fig.&nbsp;1</ce:cross-ref>. The particular question the display answers&mdash;the hypothesis that was tested statistically&mdash;is not explicitly articulated in the report document provided to the institution represented by the bold dot. Instead, as is common with performance reports, one is simply provided with an implicit &ldquo;answer,&rdquo; in this case, &ldquo;observed minus expected nosocomial infections.&rdquo; (The model of improvement is built upon the necessity for a clearly defined AIM because from that aim will come the measures that are used to create the appropriate baseline as well as the means to assess progress.) Several questions are possible, including:<ce:cross-ref refid="bib7"><ce:sup>7</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref><ce:list><ce:list-item><ce:label>1.</ce:label><ce:para>&ldquo;Which hospitals&apos; results are not compatible with the overall average?&rdquo;</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item><ce:label>2.</ce:label><ce:para>&ldquo;Which hospitals are in the top or bottom half?&rdquo;</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item><ce:label>3.</ce:label><ce:para>&ldquo;Does a particular hospital come from the same distribution as all the others; is this hospital an extraordinary performer?&rdquo;</ce:para></ce:list-item></ce:list></ce:para><ce:para>The question actually posed determines the particular conformation of the funnel-shaped curve in <ce:cross-ref refid="fig1">Fig.&nbsp;1</ce:cross-ref>. The report document specifies risk factors used in the risk adjustment model, but not the model&apos;s discriminatory or explanatory power; cautioning, however, that risk adjustment methods are imperfect. Nevertheless, thoughtful interpretation of risk-adjusted results depends on some factual understanding of just <ce:italic>how imperfect</ce:italic> is the comparison. &ldquo;All models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful&rdquo; (George Box, quoted in Schulman).<ce:cross-ref refid="bib11"><ce:sup>11</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref></ce:para><ce:para>Mindful of the foregoing caveats we can say this: lying as it does on the superimposed funnel-shaped curve, our dot in <ce:cross-ref refid="fig1">Fig.&nbsp;1</ce:cross-ref> represents a borderline &ldquo;outlier.&rdquo; The funnel curve marks the range of variation attributable to chance, &plusmn;95% control limits. Variation among dots within the control limits is more likely attributable to chance than to inherent differences in systems of care.</ce:para><ce:para>So, what does it mean to be an outlier? Only that if the model has done a good job transforming the evaluative task to a comparison of apples with apples, then we can be confident the dot differs from the overall average, the model expectation.

RPCs only knew their referring hospitals&apos; performance, not other RPCs&apos;. The extent to which centers applied best practices to prevent CLABSIs was unclear. Centers suspected that CLABSI rates and pertinent practices varied substantially among RPCs. Centers recognized that they needed an appropriate, credible standard by which to evaluate RPC performance and motivate improvement.</ce:para><ce:para>During the collaborative&apos;s first year, RPCs shared self-identified NICU bloodstream infection rates and agreed to set a standard of care via a bundle of practices &ndash; percutaneously inserted central catheters (PICCs) were specified because this line type accounted for the bulk of central line days. NYS Public Health Law Article 28 &sect; 2819 required that all NYS hospitals join the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN),<ce:cross-ref refid="bib14"><ce:sup>14</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> which made CLABSI rate available statewide. Every individual participant had to join either a Research Panel (RP) or a Quality Improvement Panel (QIP); each established defined individual responsibilities. The RP selected performance indicators; reviewed data completeness, integrity, and analysis; and identified candidate host institutions for participants to visit and learn about potential best practices. The QIP reviewed pertinent peer-reviewed literature; coordinated the visit to a potential best performing NICU (with respect to the specified indicator; ideally, one could look for the best performance on a number of indicators, as different places often do different things well); and spearheaded creation of a care bundle. Controversy arising from collaborative activities was adjudicated by both panels. Several dozen individuals visited a NICU with low indicator rate to learn about potential best practices.

Even with constant underlying risk, the proportion of neonates who will develop a CLABSI at each NICU varies every evaluation interval. CIs help to answer: &ldquo;What is the true CLABSI rate for each NICU?&rdquo; in the sense of establishing a <ce:italic>range</ce:italic> of underlying risk values compatible with observed outcomes. So, the overall CLABSI rate for NICU B during 2007 was approximately 12.7/1000 central line days. However, repeating the observations over a very long period, all else unchanged, the overall CLABSI rate for NICU B should lie between 4.6 and 27.6/1000 central line days. The computed interval width is an inverse function of patient volume. Larger samples will more accurately reflect the true population characteristics, ie, the individual estimate is more precise; CI narrows (compare NICU B with NICU J).<ce:cross-ref refid="bib7"><ce:sup>7</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref></ce:para><ce:para>Within each BW category CLABSI rates varied widely.

The strategy of a statewide collaboration is innovative for several reasons. First, because all RPCs participate, potential sampling error or bias is avoided and population-based rates can be determined. Second, because evaluated providers are directly involved in data collection, review, analysis, and interpretation, providers believe performance results. If they do not, they are empowered to identify and correct their data thereby improving data accuracy. Third, the NYSDOH Office of HAI conducted site visits to assess sites&apos; use of CLABSI case definitions and adjudicated cases.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib32"><ce:sup>32</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> Fourth, the network intends to help members improve by monitoring bundle element application and effectiveness.</ce:para><ce:para>Note that <ce:italic>no center was without CLABSI</ce:italic>.

Thus, it is sensible for New York State neonatologists to try to shift average performance and narrow the variation among NICUs.</ce:para><ce:para>Although the bundle in <ce:cross-ref refid="tbox1">Box 1</ce:cross-ref> derives from high-quality evidence, monitoring of its effectiveness is essential. The best practices collected in the bundle typically emerge by studying an individual intervention in a controlled setting (preferably a randomized controlled trial). However, in actual clinical care several best practices may be applied in combination; a procedure that assumes favorable interactions among the individual interventions. To further complicate the situation, best practices may yield varying results that depend on the myriad ways actual care settings and patients differ from the controlled circumstances operating when effectiveness was initially established. (These are critical points because it is essential to deal with the reality of daily clinical practice &ndash; in which many changes are likely to occur simultaneously. [Unlike the randomized control trial, real-life practice is very hard to tightly control.] Organizations working to improve care will often do several interventions at once.)<ce:cross-refs refid="bib35 bib36"><ce:sup>35,36</ce:sup></ce:cross-refs></ce:para><ce:para>This rationale for monitoring bundle effectiveness also begs a question: Might asking whether an intervention works or not oversimplify the situation?

As such, it may be wishful thinking to suppose that study and control groups only differ in the intervention of interest, and that no other aspects of care vary due to human factors.

The quality improvement approach of neonatologists in California incorporates this idea.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="sec3.3"><ce:section-title>California</ce:section-title><ce:section id="sec3.3.1"><ce:section-title>Network overview</ce:section-title><ce:para>California&apos;s regional NICUs provide care to the majority of complex medical and surgical neonatal patients in the state. In 2006, California Children&apos;s Services (CCS) joined in a unique collaborative relationship with the California Children&apos;s Hospital Association (CCHA) to develop and implement a statewide initiative intended to reduce CLABSIs in these NICUs.</ce:para><ce:para>The project leadership team included CCS leadership (Marian Dalsey, MD, MPH, Kathy Chance, MD, and Hallie Morrow MD, MS), quality improvement expertise (Paul Kurtin, MD, Michael Seid, PhD, and Thomas Huber, M.) and neonatal medical/nursing expertise (David D. Wirtschafter, MD, and Janet S. Pettit, MSN, NNP-BC). In 2006, 13 members of CCHA joined the project (September 2006 to December 2007), and the remaining nine regional NICUs joined in January 2008. The 22 collaborating NICUs included all eight Children&apos;s Hospitals in the state, all five University of California Hospitals, and nine large regional centers, including those for three multisite hospital systems. NICU size ranged from 23 to 84 beds and patient days in 2007 ranged from 7665 to 29,565. In 2007, these 22 units provided 285,430 NICU patient care days. The original 13 NICUs had 59,182 line days in 2006 and 73,077 in 2007. The expanded cohort will report an estimated 87,500 line days in 2008.</ce:para><ce:para>Members worked collaboratively using three face-to face meetings to initially address project goals and methods for performing QI initiatives and later to share accomplishments, challenges and means to overcome them and form consensus around new approaches to reduce CLABSIs. Biweekly phone conferences served to update members of the collaborative on the activities of each individual site, identify potential interventions, develop consensus about data definitions and collection procedures, exchange knowledge about &ldquo;best practices,&rdquo; and exchange ideas on &ldquo;promising practices.&rdquo; The project&apos;s leaders provided one on-site consultation visit during 2007 to the original 13 members. These visits provided tailored consultations aimed at helping each site identify and overcome barriers to implementing necessary changes in practice. Annual project meetings included all participants and focused on lessons learned, opportunities for continued improvement, and project assessment, followed by a presentation to and celebration with the member&apos;s CEO&apos;s and CCHA&apos;s senior leadership.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec3.3.2"><ce:section-title>Performance reports</ce:section-title><ce:para>Because we wanted to understand the performance of the collaborative as it was changing and to know whether real change was occurring, we used statistical process control (SPC) methods. Although traditional inferential statistics are commonly used to examine differences between samples from different sites or collaborative performance at different times, it requires aggregation of measures over time and thus can slow the pace of change. SPC is a branch of statistics that uses time series analysis and graphical presentation of data. Traditional inferential statistics rests on the assumption that sampled data are drawn from a stable population, whereas CLABSI rates reflect a reiterative production process whose results vary over time: ie, a NICU care system. SPC is designed to accurately characterize such variation over time&mdash;to discriminate signal from noise, how much of a change must occur for it to &ldquo;mean something&rdquo;; and to indicate whether the system performs predictably or not. NICU A may have the same annual infection rate as NICU B but NICU A may operate within a substantially narrower performance range than NICU B, so that one may reliably predict the coming month&apos;s results in NICU A, but not in NICU B.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib38"><ce:sup>38</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> Researchers and practitioners often find SPC data displays very useful for evaluating performance and guiding change.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib39"><ce:sup>39</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref></ce:para><ce:para>We created performance reports (CLABSIs per 1000 central line days) for each participating site that highlighted the large degree of variation in rates among the participating sites and compared their results with the national NHSN benchmarks.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib40"><ce:sup>40</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> The reports were primarily used to (1) create a baseline of group performance, (2) create a baseline for each site to compare itself to its own performance over time, and (3) help make the case that changes in practice are needed to both reduce variation within and between sites and to improve performance compared with national benchmarks.</ce:para><ce:para>CLABSI rates during the first year of the project fell 25% from 4.32 to 3.22 infections per 1000 catheter days comparing the baseline 2006 period to the whole of 2007. This represented 75 fewer infections annually in a population exposed to 73,000 line days. <ce:cross-ref refid="fig5">Fig.&nbsp;5</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig5"/> shows a CLABSI rate control chart for the very low birth weight (VLBW) babies. There is a downward shift in the CLABSI rate from the baseline through the intervention period. Moreover, while there is some increasing scatter during the follow-up period, this is not a strong enough shift to suggest a rising CLABSI rate. During this post-intervention period (project hiatus: July to December 2007), there were no group phone conferences and no communication regarding individual performance rates occurred.</ce:para><ce:para>The collaborative&apos;s CLABSI rate was 2.36/1000 line days for January to September 2008. It is not possible to directly compare this rate with the rates obtained in the previous year because of a change in the stringency of the NHSN CLABSI definition implemented on January 1, 2008.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib41"><ce:sup>41</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> The new one calls for two rather than one positive blood cultures when diagnosing a catheter-associated infection from a recognized contaminant.

Anecdotally, the California collaborative members report that perhaps one third of their 2007 CONS infections were not diagnosed with two blood cultures, and, even though treated, they would not have been designated as CLABSI events in 2008. A similar effect was estimated in New York State (Stricof RL, December 11, 2008, personal communication).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec3.3.3"><ce:section-title>Identifying the right ways to do the right things</ce:section-title><ce:para>The project generated many different threads of discourse and discovery, both because there exists no single vascular access &ldquo;bundle&rdquo; for neonates and because there are many technical and material challenges in meeting the needs of these patients. Thus, substantial portions of the collaborative&apos;s work consisted of developing and assessing ideas for use in the NICU. Some of the specific technical challenges considered were the following: whether, or with what restrictions, to use chlorhexidine in skin antisepsis; availability and workability of closed system vascular access devices for umbilical and peripheral vascular lines; designs of medication administration lines to lessen their exposure to bedside contaminants and to minimize the fluid load required to maintain their patency; standards on how to obtain blood cultures (considering both volume and site(s)); and revising the NSHN CLABSI criteria as they pertain to temperature assessment to reflect better the variability of neonatal temperatures and how they are measured. All of these issues, critical to the diagnosis and prevention of CLABSI, were unspecified at the beginning of the project, with no well defined and tested best practices available to be cited from the literature (<ce:cross-ref refid="tbl2">Table 2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="tbl2"/>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec3.3.4"><ce:section-title>Connecting upstream process steps with downstream outcomes</ce:section-title><ce:para>One of the key work products of this collaborative is a rich dataset describing the different paths taken by the individual centers in achieving their QI goals.

Our member&apos;s anecdotal evaluation of this process indicates that a literature-based forensic approach stimulates a more far-reaching survey for both usual and unusual &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; practices potentially contributing to a CLABSI.

Although all 22 sites met the same definition of &ldquo;regional NICU,&rdquo; there were very significant differences in staffing, the role of house staff and fellows, the mix of surgical versus VLBW neonates, other initiatives on-going in the NICU which might distract attention and resources from the CLABSI project, and the staff and technical resources available to undertake such an effort. The project team rigorously maintained focus on the intent of the project, to reduce CLABSIs, but permitted significant freedom in how individual sites tried to achieve that goal.

To achieve the first goal, the California collaborative emphasized the technical aspects of care such as proper line set up and medication administration supported by appropriate bundles, checklists, and audits to encourage clinicians to do the right thing.
