The use of this model requires practice for clinicians to be comfortable, but mastery is critical to develop the necessary skills to participate in quality improvement initiatives. The future of health care in the United States depends on every practitioner delivering safe, effective, and efficient care. The case study demonstrates how this methodology can be applied in any busy health care setting. Incorporating this approach to quality improvement into daily work will improve clinical outcomes and advance health care delivery and design.</ce:simple-para></ce:abstract-sec></ce:abstract><ce:keywords xml:lang="en"><ce:section-title>Keywords</ce:section-title><ce:keyword><ce:text>Quality Improvement</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword><ce:text>PDSA cycle</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword><ce:text>Model for improvement</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword><ce:text>Healthcare improvement</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword><ce:text>Pediatric quality</ce:text></ce:keyword></ce:keywords></head><body><ce:sections><ce:para>Health care expenditures represent a staggering portion of the United States government spending.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib1"><ce:sup>1</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> Competitive pressures and scarce resources are forcing health care organizations to reduce costs, eliminate waste, increase productivity, and ensure patient safety.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib2"><ce:sup>2</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> Continuous quality improvement is an imperative mandate for the success of health care organizations.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib3"><ce:sup>3</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> The use of formal improvement strategies is new to health care but has a long history in industry especially manufacturing. Industrial improvement initiatives were oriented toward decreasing waste, increasing efficiency, eliminating duplication and creating opportunities for expansion in industry or increasing market share.</ce:para><ce:para>The earliest industrial quality improvement efforts were pioneered by Joseph Juran, W. Edward Deming, and Philip Crosby.<ce:cross-refs refid="bib4 bib5 bib6"><ce:sup>4&ndash;6</ce:sup></ce:cross-refs> Juran&apos;s theory<ce:cross-refs refid="bib4 bib5 bib6"><ce:sup>4&ndash;6</ce:sup></ce:cross-refs> postulated the concept of fitness for use. This approach built interdisciplinary teams using various diagnostic tools to understand why certain manufacturing processes produced products that are unusable. His theories focused on determining the causes of inferior production and using that information or set of circumstances to decrease production of substandard product. A theory proposed by Philip Crosby,<ce:cross-ref refid="bib6"><ce:sup>6</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> defined quality in terms of performance, a quality performance produces zero defects. If defects are produced, these defects increase the cost of production or delivery of service and impacted on profit margin or consumer safety.</ce:para><ce:para>Deming<ce:cross-refs refid="bib5 bib7"><ce:sup>5,7</ce:sup></ce:cross-refs> made key contributions by outlining a framework of knowledge necessary for the application of the science of improvement. Deming&apos;s theory focused on four components: an appreciation of a &ldquo;system,&rdquo; understanding variation, acquisition of knowledge, and the knowledge of psychology. These factors and their interaction represent the cornerstone of improvement science. All improvement theories include the following concepts: commitment of the organization to quality; focus on the customer or consumer; modification of systems, not people; ability to foster teamwork; and encouraging group problem solving. Using improvement science, decisions are made based on objective not subjective information.</ce:para><ce:para>The effectiveness of these improvement methods in manufacturing was acknowledged by health care management. Twenty years ago, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) launched its first project called &ldquo;The National Demonstration Project on Quality Improvement in Healthcare&rdquo; which explored the application of modern quality improvement methods to health care.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib8"><ce:sup>8</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> In 1990, the landmark book <ce:italic>Curing Healthcare</ce:italic>,<ce:cross-ref refid="bib8"><ce:sup>8</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> introduced the concept of creating a culture of continuous quality improvement in health care. <ce:italic>Crossing the Quality Chasm</ce:italic>, published in 2001 by the Institute of Medicine, defined six aims of health care quality. These quality indicators recommended that patient care should be timely, effective, efficient, patient centered, safe, and equitable.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib2"><ce:sup>2</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> Even though the health care industry has made strides in improving quality of health care, major gaps persist in performance of health care systems and these gaps represent significant risk to patient safety.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib9"><ce:sup>9</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref></ce:para><ce:para>Currently, the focal point of quality improvement in health care has shifted from institutions to include individual providers. The question is often asked, &ldquo;What is quality?&rdquo; &ldquo;How is it measured?&rdquo; Health care providers are expected to assess and improve their patients&apos; outcomes but lack training in quality improvement and limits their ability to fully implement quality initiatives.<ce:cross-refs refid="bib10 bib11"><ce:sup>10,11</ce:sup></ce:cross-refs> Future trends in health care delivery will require practitioners to participate in continuous quality improvement as part of their daily practice.

The Model for Improvement is an effective and easily understood method that can be implemented by either large health care systems or a small office practice.

In the ideal scenario, they reflect the desired outcome of the improvement effort. Process or intermediate measures are related to key changes to be implemented during the improvement effort. A process measure evaluates the interval change or steps to attain the outcome of the improvement effort. These measures are usually proximal to the overall outcome. Balancing measures are used to evaluate if a change is causing unexpected effects. Change can improve one part of a system but undermine another. The most skeptical person of a group is a source for balancing measures, often they outline credible reasons why a particular project will fail or why certain goals are impossible.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib14"><ce:sup>14</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref></ce:para><ce:para>The optimal measure set includes four to eight measures; at least one should be a balancing measure.

A focus may be suggested by a compelling issue on at the national, state, regional, or local level. New evidence-based practice guidelines not implemented in a particular setting are another source of quality improvement projects. Every attempt should be made to develop a passion factor in any improvement project, because change is difficult. Topics should attract attention or generate the necessary interest to move the project forward. Finally, external pressures on providers may be the driving force of improvement projects.

Once an improvement project is under way, run charts can be converted to control charts and the process of improvement can be analyzed. Statistical control charts are frequently used in industry to monitor quality in production. This method can be readily extended to health care. These control charts illustrate if a process is in &ldquo;control,&rdquo; or within limits of acceptable variation. Data points are plotted around a mean and confidence intervals are established. Monitoring the control chart of process can detect problems with a process or special causes that are outliers to a controlled process. There are numerous types of control charts, applicable to many health care indices. For example, charts can be used to monitor the proportion of patients with a particular disease and their outcome or rare events such a central line infections that are monitored by days between infections (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig17">Fig.&nbsp;17</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig17"/>).</ce:para><ce:para>Another advanced improvement methodology is planned experimentation. This method conducts a series of tests under varying conditions. This methodology is different from most familiar scientific experimentation. Under traditional experiments, factors under study are tightly controlled. Planned experimentation uses series of tests that are performed by changing levels of factors and background variables and observing the effects. In planned experimentation, factors are not controlled but are used in combination to see what effect is achieved. This type of experimentation is more oriented toward real world occurrences, because rarely can the health care system operate in perfectly controlled situations.</ce:para><ce:section id="sec5.1.1"><ce:section-title>Case study (continued)</ce:section-title><ce:para>Super Smart Pediatrics has worked diligently on asthma care for their patients and has made impressive gains.

After implementing several office changes they reached their goal for offering smoking cessation materials to most of their parents that smoked (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig17">Fig.&nbsp;17</ce:cross-ref>). After several weeks and improvements, their process of delivery of smoking cessation materials was noted to be in control. The practice noticed they were all offering different advice on smoking cessation and were unsure what method to endorse. They decided to do a small planned experiment using a factorial design in the practice offering many options and combinations for smoking cessation to determine which methods seem to have success in their practice (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig18">Fig.&nbsp;18</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig18"/>).</ce:para><ce:para>Using planned experimentation, several short test cycles can be performed in order to identify factors that may effect a particular outcome.

Initial factorial results for Super Smart Pediatrics showed the combination of the quit line, patch and follow up calls were the most strongly associated with smoking cessation and lack of asthma exacerbation.

Use of this model requires practice for clinicians to be comfortable, however it is critical to develop the necessary skills to participate in quality improvement initiatives. The future of health care in the United States depends on every practitioner delivering safe, effective, and efficient care. The case study demonstrates how this methodology can be applied in any busy health care setting. Incorporating this approach to quality improvement into daily work will improve clinical outcomes, advance health care delivery and design. The techniques of planned experimentation can further an improvement project, refine interventions, gain further improvement, and standardize processes to ensure reliability.
