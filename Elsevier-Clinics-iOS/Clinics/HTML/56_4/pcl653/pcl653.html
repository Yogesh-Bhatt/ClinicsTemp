<p class="normal">The Model for Improvement is a rigorous and reasonable method for busy health care practitioners to use to improve patient outcomes. The use of this model requires practice for clinicians to be comfortable, but mastery is critical to develop the necessary skills to participate in quality improvement initiatives. The future of health care in the United States depends on every practitioner delivering safe, effective, and efficient care. The case study demonstrates how this methodology can be applied in any busy health care setting. Incorporating this approach to quality improvement into daily work will improve clinical outcomes and advance health care delivery and design.</p>

<p id="lv_0003" class="level1">
<p class="indent1">Health care expenditures represent a staggering portion of the United States government spending.<a title="" href="#bib1" name="back-bib1"><sup>1</sup></a> Competitive pressures and scarce resources are forcing health care organizations to reduce costs, eliminate waste, increase productivity, and ensure patient safety.<a title="" href="#bib2" name="back-bib2"><sup>2</sup></a> Continuous quality improvement is an imperative mandate for the success of health care organizations.<a title="" href="#bib3" name="back-bib3"><sup>3</sup></a> The use of formal improvement strategies is new to health care but has a long history in industry especially manufacturing. Industrial improvement initiatives were oriented toward decreasing waste, increasing efficiency, eliminating duplication and creating opportunities for expansion in industry or increasing market share.</p>
<p class="indent">The earliest industrial quality improvement efforts were pioneered by Joseph Juran, W. Edward Deming, and Philip Crosby.<a name="back-bib4" href="#bib4"><sup>4–6</sup></a> Juran's theory<a name="back-bib4" href="#bib4"><sup>4–6</sup></a> postulated the concept of fitness for use. This approach built interdisciplinary teams using various diagnostic tools to understand why certain manufacturing processes produced products that are unusable. His theories focused on determining the causes of inferior production and using that information or set of circumstances to decrease production of substandard product. A theory proposed by Philip Crosby,<a title="" href="#bib6" name="back-bib6"><sup>6</sup></a> defined quality in terms of performance, a quality performance produces zero defects. If defects are produced, these defects increase the cost of production or delivery of service and impacted on profit margin or consumer safety.</p>
<p class="indent">Deming<a name="back-bib5" href="#bib5"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib7" href="#bib7"><sup>7</sup></a> made key contributions by outlining a framework of knowledge necessary for the application of the science of improvement. Deming's theory focused on four components: an appreciation of a “system,” understanding variation, acquisition of knowledge, and the knowledge of psychology. These factors and their interaction represent the cornerstone of improvement science. All improvement theories include the following concepts: commitment of the organization to quality; focus on the customer or consumer; modification of systems, not people; ability to foster teamwork; and encouraging group problem solving. Using improvement science, decisions are made based on objective not subjective information.</p>
<p class="indent">The effectiveness of these improvement methods in manufacturing was acknowledged by health care management. Twenty years ago, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) launched its first project called “The National Demonstration Project on Quality Improvement in Healthcare” which explored the application of modern quality improvement methods to health care.<a title="" href="#bib8" name="back-bib8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 1990, the landmark book <i>Curing Healthcare</i>,<a title="" href="#bib8" name="back-bib8"><sup>8</sup></a> introduced the concept of creating a culture of continuous quality improvement in health care. <i>Crossing the Quality Chasm</i>, published in 2001 by the Institute of Medicine, defined six aims of health care quality. These quality indicators recommended that patient care should be timely, effective, efficient, patient centered, safe, and equitable.<a title="" href="#bib2" name="back-bib2"><sup>2</sup></a> Even though the health care industry has made strides in improving quality of health care, major gaps persist in performance of health care systems and these gaps represent significant risk to patient safety.<a title="" href="#bib9" name="back-bib9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Currently, the focal point of quality improvement in health care has shifted from institutions to include individual providers. The question is often asked, “What is quality?” “How is it measured?” Health care providers are expected to assess and improve their patients' outcomes but lack training in quality improvement and limits their ability to fully implement quality initiatives.<a name="back-bib10" href="#bib10"><sup>10</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib11" href="#bib11"><sup>11</sup></a> Future trends in health care delivery will require practitioners to participate in continuous quality improvement as part of their daily practice. Acquisition of this skill set will become as important as the underlying medical knowledge used to diagnose and treat disease.<a title="" href="#bib12" name="back-bib12"><sup>12</sup></a> The process of quality improvement requires careful planning, thorough documentation, consistent analysis, and openmindedness to results. Fortunately, there are methods and tools to assist the practitioner in the development of quality improvement skills.<a title="" href="#bib13" name="back-bib13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p id="lv_0004" class="level2">The model for improvement</p>
<p class="indent">All methodology of quality improvement is based on the same underlying theories of improvement science.<a name="back-bib4" href="#bib4"><sup>4–6,13</sup></a> Associates in Process Improvement (API) developed the Model for Improvement in 1996<a title="" href="#bib13" name="back-bib13"><sup>13</sup></a> to illustrate how to facilitate change. The Model for Improvement is an effective and easily understood method that can be implemented by either large health care systems or a small office practice. This model uses methodology that produces specific, measurable results. The IHI and other leading health care quality improvement organizations utilize the Model for Improvement to advance health care quality projects (<a title="" href="#fig1" name="back-fig1" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">An Aim statement captures early decisions, aligns the team, communicates with others and acts as a touchstone throughout an improvement project. This document is key to successful projects, many projects fail due to flaws in the Aim statement. The goals included in the Aim statement should be measurable, numeric and preferable absolute rather than relative. Attaining the goals should be a stretch, achievable not impossible, not business as usual.<a name="back-bib13" href="#bib13"><sup>13</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib14" href="#bib14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p id="lv_0008" class="level4">How will we know if a change is an improvement?</p>
<p class="indent">“<i>All improvement is change but not all change is an improvement</i>” (Box 1).<a title="" href="#bib13" name="back-bib13"><sup>13</sup></a> “How will we know that a change is an improvement?” is a question often asked during the improvement process. To adequately assess change, three types of measures are used in improvement science: outcome, process, and balancing measures.<a title="" href="#bib13" name="back-bib13"><sup>13</sup></a><i>Outcome</i> measures are global measures, directed related to the Aim statement. In the ideal scenario, they reflect the desired outcome of the improvement effort. Process or intermediate measures are related to key changes to be implemented during the improvement effort. A process measure evaluates the interval change or steps to attain the outcome of the improvement effort. These measures are usually proximal to the overall outcome. Balancing measures are used to evaluate if a change is causing unexpected effects. Change can improve one part of a system but undermine another. The most skeptical person of a group is a source for balancing measures, often they outline credible reasons why a particular project will fail or why certain goals are impossible.<a title="" href="#bib14" name="back-bib14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The optimal measure set includes four to eight measures; at least one should be a balancing measure. All of the measures must be aligned with the Aim statement. The most successful improvement projects have measures that are easily collected and improvement can be shown quickly.<a name="back-bib14" href="#bib14"><sup>14</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib15" href="#bib15"><sup>15</sup></a> Methods for data collection should be simple and easily integrated into daily work. The results of any improvement efforts should be displayed graphically over time through the use of simple run charts. A run chart shows a pattern or trend over time. These charts should be annotated to show implementation of a change, explain a result or note an unusual circumstance<a name="back-bib16" href="#bib16"><sup>16</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib17" href="#bib17"><sup>17</sup></a> (<a title="" href="#fig2" name="back-fig2" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 2</a>).

<p id="lv_0009" class="level4">What changes can we make that will result in an improvement?</p>
<p class="indent">The Model for Improvement permits testing of ideas or changes or implementing change concepts that have worked in other settings (Box 1). Change concepts are general approaches to change, the rationale is to generate specific ideas to test.<a title="" href="#bib13" name="back-bib13"><sup>13</sup></a> These concepts may be feasible and effective in one setting but may need adaptation to a new setting. Change concepts need to be altered to fit the existing culture, resources, or institutional goals. Ideally, a change concept initially is a vague or innovative strategic idea that is further whittled down to a specific actionable idea or change that can be tested.<a title="" href="#bib13" name="back-bib13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Another method to support change is a <i>change package</i>. A change package is a group or set of changes that through evidence-based study can affect a particular outcome. For example, the of use asthma action plans, the use of inhaled corticosteroids in moderate asthma, and having an identified primary care provider/pediatric medical home are elements of an asthma care change package. These items used as a group, have been shown to produce improvement of asthma care in some health care settings.</p>

<p id="lv_0010" class="level3">Using Plan-Do-Study-Act Cycles to Test an Idea or Change</p>
<p class="indent">Walter Shewart, in 1924, penned a one-page memo outlining his idea of quality processes.<a title="" href="#bib18" name="back-bib18"><sup>18</sup></a> From his work came the PDCA cycle, later referred to as the PDSA cycle. The plan-do-study-act cycle (PDSA cycle) is a short rapid cycle used to test an idea or a change (<a title="" href="#fig3" name="back-fig3" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p id="lv_0011" class="level4">The P phase</p>
<p class="indent">The objective for the learning should be stated with clear assumptions. All details of the plan serve as documentation for the implementation of subsequent phases.</p>
<div id="sec2.2.2" />
<p id="lv_0012" class="level4">The D phase</p>
<p class="indent">The data collection phase indicates the collection process, any barriers to the process or unexpected occurrences that may affect the interpretation of the data.</p>
<div id="sec2.2.3" />
<p id="lv_0013" class="level4">The S phase</p>
<p class="indent">During this phase, data are studied and interpreted. The analysis is then compared with the initial predictions or assumptions. Data should be displayed in a run chart or Pareto chart. (A Pareto chart is a bar graph reflecting the frequency of occurrence, illustrating the predominance of a specific cause.) PDSA cycles may use either qualitative or qualitative data. This phase should review the data collection instrument, its use, and ease of collection. The data are specific to the cycle and end with the cycle.</p>
<div id="sec2.2.4" />
<p id="lv_0014" class="level4">The A phase</p>
<p class="indent">The last step in the cycle, analyzing the data collected to attain new learning or knowledge, addresses required changes in the testing process and poses additional questions to be answered before implementing a change.</p>
<p class="indent">PDSA cycles assist improvement teams in adapting good ideas to their specific situation. When used appropriately, PDSA cycles force small-scale thinking. The PDSA cycle promotes detailed stepwise thinking, allows for making predictions, forces thoughtful deliberation on the increased knowledge, and subsequently facilitates change. Use of small-scale change can cause rapid adaptation and implementation of change in various health care settings (<a title="" href="#fig3" name="back-fig3" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 3</a>).<a name="back-bib13" href="#bib13"><sup>13</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib14" href="#bib14"><sup>14</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib18" href="#bib18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p id="lv_0015" class="level2">Case study</p>
<p class="indent">Super Smart Pediatrics is a suburban practice, with a diverse patient base, that includes numerous insurance plans. The practice has 7 full-time doctors, 3 part-time doctors, several midlevel providers, 10 nurses, and 15 front office and medical record staff. The practice has grown significantly over the past 15 years and currently serves 15,000 patients.</p>
<p class="indent">The practice manger of Super Smart Pediatrics noted that recently there were more complaints from office staff, practice providers, and patients. During a casual discussion with the practice manager, one of the partners revealed her frustration with working harder and harder, and feeling overwhelmed especially by patients with chronic diseases. She felt there was never enough time to address all the necessary patient issues. Her partners treated illnesses in different fashions leading to confusion among patients. In addition, the number of new patients enrolling in the practice had decreased over the past 2 years and two neighboring practices were growing and adding additional staff.</p>
<p class="indent">After several discussions with other staff members, Super Smart Pediatrics' employees and partners realized many of them were concerned with the direction of the practice. Two of the partners and the office manager visited several other practices and had some frank discussions with their colleagues. They observed different approaches that were successful in other offices but were unsure where to begin.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, the practice manger had kept a log of all the complaints from the previous year, he was able to divide the complaints into three categories: Office Efficiency, Staff Efficiency, and Provider Efficiency. The Pareto chart in <a title="" href="#fig4" name="back-fig4" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 4</a> illustrates the data.</p>

<p id="lv_0016" class="level3">Identifying the Problem</p>
<p class="indent">Super Smart Pediatrics identified a problem through frustration and job dissatisfaction of a partner and office manager. Identification of a concern, problem, or deficiency may come from various sources. Sources may include the work environment, recurring problems or a special interest of the staff. Strategic thinking will identify projects that are sensible and feasible for a particular group, practice, or organization. A focus may be suggested by a compelling issue on at the national, state, regional, or local level. New evidence-based practice guidelines not implemented in a particular setting are another source of quality improvement projects. Every attempt should be made to develop a passion factor in any improvement project, because change is difficult. Topics should attract attention or generate the necessary interest to move the project forward. Finally, external pressures on providers may be the driving force of improvement projects. For example, recently established requirements for Part IV of Maintenance of Certification are “sparking” the interest of many providers to participate in office-based quality improvement projects.<a name="back-bib11" href="#bib11"><sup>11,13–15</sup></a></p>

<p id="lv_0018" class="level4">Case study (continued)</p>
<p class="indent">After several staff meetings, Super Smart Pediatrics decided to focus on provider variability. The practice decided to focus on asthma since it was the most common chronic illness seen in the practice. The new National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines were not being implemented uniformly in the practice and subsequently this lead to confusion by both staff and patients. An improvement team was assembled from front office, billing, nurses, midlevel providers, and physicians. A future goal was to add an interested parent or patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Once a project has been identified, it is important to assemble a team because quality improvement is not a solo endeavor but a “team sport.” Successful projects recruit team members from all disciplines. Several team options exist ranging from a small core group to larger groups that include all the stakeholders. The ideal size is 4 to 8 team members, as larger groups may limit ability to make decisions and move forward. Ad hoc team members may include specific content experts and allied health care professionals<a name="back-bib19" href="#bib19"><sup>19–21</sup></a> (<a class="ja50-ce-inter-ref" href="http://www.lchcape.org" target="_blank">www.lchcape.org</a> for team chart).</p>

<p class="indent">Sharing the Aim statement with others not directly involved in the project often provides a new perspective on the problem. The objectives should be clear even to those not involved with the project. Feedback should be sought about goals and their measurement. It is critical that the Aim statement is reviewed by supervisors and senior leadership or practice management. Is project compelling? Is it aligned with strategic objectives of the organization or practice?

<p class="indent">Super Smart Pediatrics Asthma Team developed their Aim statement using existing change concepts. The Super Smart Pediatrics Asthma Team realized that identification of asthma patients in the practice was necessary for all future steps. The first PDSA cycle (PDSA Planner 1) illustrated that the providers had different criteria for the diagnosis of asthma and coded/billed differently. The team used a simple check sheet to gather data and used a Pareto chart to display the results (<a title="" href="#fig6" name="back-fig6" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Figs. 6</a> and <a title="" href="#fig7" name="back-fig7" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">7</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Smart Start Pediatrics was slowly identifying the patients with asthma. The team used the concept of brainstorming (<a class="ja50-ce-inter-ref" href="http://www.lchcape.org" target="_blank">www.lchcape.org</a>) to cultivate ideas to speed the process. During discussions, they realized that another system problem may be part of the solution. The practice experienced a tremendous demand for flu shots that they were unable to meet during the winter and realized better planning was needed. The practice decided on a mass mailing survey to gauge patient interest in a flu shot clinic. The team added one question to the survey: “Does your child have asthma?” Using an informal survey to assess flu shot interest, the practice identified 658 additional patients with asthma. The total number of identified patients with asthma in the practice was similar to the 5% of the practice previously expected. The Super Smart Pediatric Asthma Team decided to trial a flow sheet for patient's charts to decrease the variation of asthma care received by each patient. Several of the measures from the Aim statement were readily assessable from the flow sheet (<a title="" href="#fig11" name="back-fig11" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 11</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Super Smart Pediatrics expected to easily identify all the patients with asthma. Several PDSAs were needed to identify those patients targeted in their quality improvement project. To increase learning during a failed test, the following questions should be asked: Was the test conducted well? Does the change tested need modification in our setting? Could the measures detect improvement or were they insufficient? Was the prediction or theory wrong?<a name="back-bib13" href="#bib13"><sup>13</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib14" href="#bib14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">With successful tests, knowledge and learning will increase. As implementation of the change nears, testing should occur under as many conditions as possible. Prior thinking to special situations, busy times, vacations, or other factors are essential for successful change. Effective changes are made by conducting many test cycles to increase learning before implementing the changes to the entire practice or setting. After making a change a team should ask “What did we expect to happen? What did happen? Where there unintended consequences? What was the best thing about this change, the worst? What might we do next?” Reflection on the cycle is as important as the performance of the cycle. The learning and knowledge from a failed test is as important as a successful test.</p>
<p class="indent">After testing a change on a small scale, learning and refining from each PDSA allows for implementation on a broader scale. Implementation is the permanent change to the way work is done.<a title="" href="#bib13" name="back-bib13"><sup>13</sup></a> This step involves building the change into the system or workflow. Hardwiring change effects documentation, written policies, hiring, training, and possibly compensation. For example, testing a change may include a small number of providers using the asthma flow sheet as portrayed in PDSA 4 and 5 (<a title="" href="#fig14" name="back-fig14" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 14</a>). Implementation is the extension to the entire group of practitioners.</p>
<p class="indent">By using the Model for Improvement, health care providers can successfully identify areas that require change or improvement, set goals and determine measures, test changes and ideas using the PDSA cycle and then implementing those changes also using the PDSA cycle.</p>

<p class="indent">
<p class="normal">“There will come a time when you think you are finished. That will be the beginning.” Louis L'Amour</p>
</p>
<p class="indent">Change is difficult but sustaining change is even more complex. Once change has been implemented, there is a tendency to revert to the old system. To overcome this tendency, several sustainability strategies must be introduced. These strategies include assigning ownership, hardwiring the change into the system, periodic measurement and feedback, and involvement of senior leadership.<a title="" href="#bib25" name="back-bib25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Hardwiring sustainability into a new system is imperative. “The old way” has to be more difficult or inconvenient to perform. Organizations that are successful in sustaining improvement involve all staff and build the improvement-related expectations into job descriptions, evaluations, and merits. These organizations are not just focused on “the project” but incorporate improvement into the fabric of daily work. Concrete plans for turnover and absences, staff orientation, and training are all methods to sustain an improvement effort. Accountability is a core principle of sustaining improvement. Finally, educating patients about the improvement effort encourages staff to remain consistent and extends accountability.<a name="back-bib14" href="#bib14"><sup>14</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib25" href="#bib25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Ongoing measurement is vital to sustaining any improvements.<a name="back-bib16" href="#bib16"><sup>16</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib17" href="#bib17"><sup>17</sup></a> The measurement process is shifted into audit mode. Data collection should occur with a frequency to detect if the process is losing gains; depending on the project this may be monthly or weekly. Data should be openly displayed and discussed. Successes, no matter how small, should be celebrated. By showcasing the staff and their successes, a culture that is data driven will slowly emerge. These victories can be used for marketing or further accreditation. A more in-depth discussion of data during the sustainability phase of improvement is available in the article by Randolph and colleagues found elsewhere in this issue.</p>
<p class="indent">The final strategy for sustaining improvement is the involvement of senior leadership.<a name="back-bib27" href="#bib27"><sup>27</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib28" href="#bib28"><sup>28</sup></a> Senior leadership involvement enables a shift from a project view to a strategic vision. The creation of a shared vision is essential to sustaining improvement. “The one-year project view,” must be eliminated by senior management to guarantee success of any improvement project. The effort required to sustain improvement is often more than is needed to spread improvement. Sustaining and spreading of improvement often overlap, spreading an improvement project, particularly in large organizations, is often started before improvement gains are sustained.</p>

<p class="indent">This work has become the landmark writing on spreading improvement. Spread of improvements in health care is different from spread of other innovations.<a title="" href="#bib30" name="back-bib30"><sup>30</sup></a> When making an assessment of improvements gained, several factors that impact spread must be considered.<a title="" href="#bib29" name="back-bib29"><sup>29</sup></a><span class="ja50-ce-list"><span class="list-item"><span class="ja50-ce-list-item-label">▪</span> <span class="list-item-content">Relative advantage over current practice<span class="ja50-ce-list"><span class="list-item"><span class="ja50-ce-list-item-label">•</span> <span class="list-item-content">Compatibility with current practice</span></span><span class="list-item"><span class="ja50-ce-list-item-label">•</span> <span class="list-item-content">Simplicity of change</span></span><span class="list-item"><span class="ja50-ce-list-item-label">•</span> <span class="list-item-content">Trialability—test change with little investment (risk/cost/time)</span></span><span class="list-item"><span class="ja50-ce-list-item-label">•</span> <span class="list-item-content">Observability of change, results need to be seen by those adopting the change</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="indent">The improvement must be communicated effectively, this may occur person to person, or through much broader channels.<a name="back-bib14" href="#bib14"><sup>14</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib29" href="#bib29"><sup>29</sup></a> Time is required for the spread of the improvement to occur. Spread does not occur all at once in a population, rather it is linear across people depending on their receptivity to change and the kind of evidence they need.</p>
<p class="indent">Spread may be more difficult in a group of independent practices versus an integrated health care system. Spread can occur at different levels: from one physician in a practice to the entire practice; from one practice site to all the sites of that practice; or between organizations or hospitals. Each level will require different motivators and incentives. In health care, spreading improvements does depend on key individuals, the messenger, and the “stickiness” of the message. “<i>This change will save money for the health care system versus. this change will help get you home earlier.”</i><a title="" href="#bib30" name="back-bib30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">One critical success factor for spread is the role of leadership.<a name="back-bib24" href="#bib24"><sup>24</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib27" href="#bib27"><sup>27</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a name="back-bib28" href="#bib28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">There are islands of improvement in many organizations or practices, but without commitment from leadership most improvements fail to spread. For further information on spread, refer to the white paper “A Framework for Spread” is available on the IHI Web site, <a class="ja50-ce-inter-ref" href="http://www.ihi.org" target="_blank">www.ihi.org</a>, and can be used at all levels of spread.<a title="" href="#bib31" name="back-bib31"><sup>31</sup></a> Leaders must inspire and communicate a shared vision; model the way; challenge the current process, no longer accepting the status quo; enable others with resources, training, and time; and encourage the heart by celebrating the successes.<a title="" href="#bib27" name="back-bib27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In our case study, Super Smart Pediatrics' level of spread was from one physician to the entire practice. The leadership of the founding partner was a key element in the success. The changes made by the pilot physician and the team demonstrated improved asthma care. Measurement and feedback became a routine part of their monthly provider meetings.</p>
<div id="sec5.1" />
<p id="lv_0027" class="level3">Advanced Improvement Methods</p>
<p class="indent">Using the model of improvement, any quality initiative can be successful. Once an improvement project is under way, run charts can be converted to control charts and the process of improvement can be analyzed. Statistical control charts are frequently used in industry to monitor quality in production. This method can be readily extended to health care. These control charts illustrate if a process is in “control,” or within limits of acceptable variation. Data points are plotted around a mean and confidence intervals are established. Monitoring the control chart of process can detect problems with a process or special causes that are outliers to a controlled process. There are numerous types of control charts, applicable to many health care indices. For example, charts can be used to monitor the proportion of patients with a particular disease and their outcome or rare events such a central line infections that are monitored by days between infections (<a title="" href="#fig17" name="back-fig17" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 17</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Another advanced improvement methodology is planned experimentation. This method conducts a series of tests under varying conditions. This methodology is different from most familiar scientific experimentation. Under traditional experiments, factors under study are tightly controlled. Planned experimentation uses series of tests that are performed by changing levels of factors and background variables and observing the effects. In planned experimentation, factors are not controlled but are used in combination to see what effect is achieved. This type of experimentation is more oriented toward real world occurrences, because rarely can the health care system operate in perfectly controlled situations.</p>

<p class="indent">Super Smart Pediatrics has worked diligently on asthma care for their patients and has made impressive gains. They realized their patients with asthma were improved but continue to have exacerbations. They postulated that smoking by parents was having some impact on their patients' asthma and they wanted to encourage smoking cessation. After implementing several office changes they reached their goal for offering smoking cessation materials to most of their parents that smoked (<a title="" href="#fig17" name="back-fig17" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 17</a>). After several weeks and improvements, their process of delivery of smoking cessation materials was noted to be in control. The practice noticed they were all offering different advice on smoking cessation and were unsure what method to endorse. They decided to do a small planned experiment using a factorial design in the practice offering many options and combinations for smoking cessation to determine which methods seem to have success in their practice (<a title="" href="#fig18" name="back-fig18" class="ja50-ce-cross-ref">Fig. 18</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using planned experimentation, several short test cycles can be performed in order to identify factors that may effect a particular outcome. Using factorial design, many factors can be studied simultaneously using only a few patients. As more knowledge is accumulated, more assumptions regarding the effect of the factors and their interaction can be made. Initial factorial results for Super Smart Pediatrics showed the combination of the quit line, patch and follow up calls were the most strongly associated with smoking cessation and lack of asthma exacerbation. As a factor, a smoking contract seemed not to have any impact. As more knowledge is obtained, the number of factors can be revised and their interaction studied further. For further information on Planned Experimentation and Factorial design, see the book <i>Quality Improvement through Planned Experimentation</i>.<a title="" href="#bib32" name="back-bib32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p id="lv_0029" class="level2">Summary</p>
<p class="indent">The Model for Improvement is a rigorous and reasonable method for busy health care practitioners to use to improve patient outcomes. Use of this model requires practice for clinicians to be comfortable, however it is critical to develop the necessary skills to participate in quality improvement initiatives. The future of health care in the United States depends on every practitioner delivering safe, effective, and efficient care. The case study demonstrates how this methodology can be applied in any busy health care setting. Incorporating this approach to quality improvement into daily work will improve clinical outcomes, advance health care delivery and design. The techniques of planned experimentation can further an improvement project, refine interventions, gain further improvement, and standardize processes to ensure reliability. Further information, training, and resources can be found in the many organizations now dedicated to improving the quality of health care.</p>
